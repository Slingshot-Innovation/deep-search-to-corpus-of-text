              "summary": "### Overview of the Death Penalty in Japan\n\n#### Historical Context and Methods\nHistorically, Japan has employed a range of execution methods including garrotting, beheading, and ritual forced suicide. However, since the modern penal code was established, hanging has become the standard method of execution.\n\n#### Modern Legal Framework\n- **Legal Basis**: Capital punishment is legally sanctioned in Japan under the Penal Code, which lists 14 capital crimes. However, it is primarily applied for aggravated murder.\n- **Sentencing**: Death sentences in Japan are typically handed down in cases involving multiple murders, though extreme brutality or ransom-related single murders can also lead to the death penalty.\n- **Execution Protocol**: Executions are carried out by long drop hanging and are required to be performed in utmost secrecy. There are seven execution chambers located in major cities.\n\n#### Recent Trends and Statistics\n- **Execution Data**: Since 2000, 98 inmates have been executed. The latest execution was of Tomohiro Katō, perpetrator of the Akihabara massacre, in July 2022.\n- **Death Row Status**: As of early 2024, there are 106 individuals on death row.\n- **Notable Pause**: No executions were carried out in 2023, a break attributed to political factors and changes within the Justice Ministry. \n\n#### Public Opinion and Advocacy\n- **Public Support**: The death penalty enjoys strong support among the Japanese public. According to a 2019 poll by the Cabinet Office, 80.8% of respondents support its continuation. Even when the alternative of life imprisonment without parole was presented, a majority preferred continuing capital punishment.\n- **Legal and Ethical Challenges**: There are ongoing legal challenges against the secrecy of execution notifications and the mental strain it causes inmates. The Japan Federation Bar Association advocates for abolition or at least significant reforms.\n\n#### Political and International Context\n- **G7 Context**: Japan and the United States are the only G7 countries that retain the death penalty. Japan's non-execution stance in 2023 was notably influenced by international scrutiny as Japan chaired the G7 that year.\n- **Administrative Handling**: The Japanese law mandates the Justice Minister to authorize executions within six months of a finalized death sentence, but executions typically occur much later due to extensive sentence reviews averaging about 15 years.\n\n### Summary:\nJapan maintains a meticulous and secretive execution protocol primarily focused on aggravated murder cases. Recent political shifts have caused intermittent pauses in executions, yet the public and legal landscape remain largely supportive of capital punishment. Legal challenges continue to be mounted against current practices, hinting at potential future reforms or abolition efforts."

              "summary": "The information collected on the Japanese death penalty highlights several key aspects:\n\n1. **Decline in Executions**: Japan did not perform any executions in 2023, making the United States the only G7 country to conduct executions that year. This marked a significant pause in Japan's practice, attributed to various political and administrative factors.\n\n2. **Legal Requirements**: Japanese law mandates that the Justice Minister schedule an execution within six months after a death sentence is finalized. However, in practice, prisoners typically spend an average of 15 years on death row during extensive reviews. \n\n3. **Recent and Historical Data**: Since 2000, 98 inmates have been executed in Japan. The most recent execution occurred on July 26, 2022, when Tomohiro Katō was hanged for the 2008 Akihabara massacre. Currently, Japan has around 106 to 107 individuals on death row.\n\n4. **Method and Secrecy**: Executions in Japan are carried out by long drop hanging in one of seven execution chambers across the country. The process is highly secretive, with prisoners informed of their execution only one hour before it occurs, and their families and lawyers notified posthumously.\n\n5. **Political and Social Context**: The lack of executions in 2023 was partially due to heightened international scrutiny as Japan presided over the G7. Additionally, the political fallout from former Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi's resignation in 2022, following inappropriate comments about the death penalty, complicated the scheduling of executions under his successor, Ken Saito. There were also issues related to prison guard misconduct influencing the prioritization of capital punishment.\n\n6. **Advocacy and Public Opinion**: The Japan Federation Bar Association has long advocated for the abolition of the death penalty and improvement in capital defense representation. Despite these efforts, public support for the death penalty remains high. A 2019 poll showed that 80.8% of respondents supported the death penalty, though this figure dropped to 52.0% when the alternative of life imprisonment without parole was considered.\n\nThis timeline and context provide a comprehensive view of the current state, legal framework, recent practice, and societal attitudes towards the death penalty in Japan."

              "summary": "### Evolution of Capital Punishment Laws in Japan\n\n#### Historical Overview\nJapan retains the death penalty, primarily using it for severe cases, particularly aggravated murders. Although 14 crimes are technically eligible for capital punishment under the Penal Code of Japan, its application is almost exclusively limited to murder cases, especially those involving multiple victims or acts of extreme brutality. The method of execution in Japan is long drop hanging, conducted in one of seven execution chambers across the country.\n\n#### Recent Application and Trends\n- **Executions Since 2000**: Since 2000, 98 inmates have been executed in Japan. The most recent execution was that of Tomohiro Katō, carried out on July 26, 2022, for his role in the 2008 Akihabara massacre.\n- **Current Death Row Statistics**: As of the latest reports, there are 107 inmates on death row in Japan, awaiting execution. The system requires that an execution be scheduled within six months of a finalized death sentence, but in practice, inmates often wait about 15 years while their sentences are reviewed.\n\n#### Public and Political Climate\nPublic support for capital punishment remains strong in Japan. A 2019 Cabinet Office poll indicated that 80.8% of Japanese adults favored the continued use of the death penalty, while only 9% supported its abolition. However, when the possibility of life sentencing without parole was introduced into the debate, the support for the death penalty dropped to 52%.\n\n#### Legal and Procedural Dynamics\n- **Secrecy and Solitary Confinement**: Executions in Japan are carried out with a high degree of secrecy. Death row inmates are kept in strict solitary confinement, monitored constantly via surveillance cameras, and are usually informed of their execution merely one hour before it occurs.\n- **Legal Challenges**: In November 2021, two death row inmates filed a lawsuit against the Japanese government, claiming that the practice of informing prisoners about their execution on the day it is to be carried out is unconstitutional and causes undue mental distress.\n\n#### Impact of Political Developments\nThe execution schedule is significantly impacted by political factors. For example, in 2023, no executions were carried out in Japan, partly due to international scrutiny and political complications following the resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022. His resignation was sparked by inappropriate comments he made about the death penalty, complicating the political environment for executions under his successor, Ken Saito.\n\n#### Critical Observations\n- **International Context**: Among the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized democracies, Japan and the United States are the only countries that still practice capital punishment.\n- **Advocacy and Reform**: While the Japan Federation Bar Association advocates for the abolition of the death penalty and the enhancement of the role of defense counsel in capital cases, these efforts have yet to achieve significant legislative change due to the strong public support for maintaining the death penalty.\n\n### Conclusion\nJapan's capital punishment laws and practices are defined by a complex interplay of legal stipulations, public opinion, and political dynamics. Despite international scrutiny and internal advocacy for abolition, the death penalty remains a well-supported and practiced component of Japan's criminal justice system."

As a method, Japan uses long drop hanging, and executions are carried out in one of seven execution chambers across major cities.\n- **Legal Framework**: The Penal Code of Japan lists 14 capital crimes, but the death penalty is predominantly enforced for serious cases of murder. Notably, instigating foreign aggression is the only crime with a mandatory death sentence.\n- **Public Opinion**: There is high public support for the death penalty in Japan, with surveys showing over 80% approval for its continuation as of 2019.\n\n#### Recent Executions and Current Death Row Statistics\n\n- **Recent Execution**: The most recent execution in Japan was of Tomohiro Katō, who was hanged on July 26, 2022, for the Akihabara massacre in 2008.\n- **Death Row Inmates**: As of the latest data, 107 inmates are awaiting execution in Japan. The average wait time on death row is approximately 15 years, despite a legal requirement for the Justice Minister to schedule executions within six months of a finalized death sentence.\n\n#### 2023 Pause in Executions\n\n- **No Executions in 2023**: No executions were carried out in Japan in 2023, making the U.S. the only G7 country to perform death penalties that year.\n- **Reasons for Pause**:\n  - **International Scrutiny**: Japan's role as the presiding country over the G7 in 2023 may have increased international attention and scrutiny, influencing the decision to halt executions.\n  - **Political Turmoil**: The resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022 due to controversial remarks about the death penalty contributed to the delay, as his successor Ken Saito faced difficulties authorizing executions.\n  - **Prison Scandals**: Incidents involving prisoner abuse by guards and consequent political sensitivities further complicated the scheduling of executions.\n\n#### Advocacy and Legal Challenges\n\n- **Advocacy by the Japan Federation of Bar Associations**: The federation has been advocating for enhanced roles for capital defense counsel and broader efforts towards the abolition of the death penalty.\n- **Legal Challenges**: In November 2021, two death row prisoners filed a lawsuit seeking damages for the psychological distress caused by being informed of their execution only one hour prior. This practice has been criticized as inhumane and unconstitutional.\n\n### Noteworthy Historical Cases\n\n- **Tomohiro Katō (Akihabara Massacre)**: Katō’s case is significant due to the brutality and high-profile nature of the crime, where he killed seven people in 2008.\n- **Norio Nagayama**: Executed in August 1987, Nagayama's case is often discussed in the context of capital punishment debates in Japan.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nJapan maintains a retentionist stance on the death penalty with substantial public support despite significant international and internal criticisms. The recent halt in executions, influenced by political and social contexts, marks a notable pause rather than a shift in policy. Japan's approach to capital punishment, characterized by secrecy and extended death row periods, continues to be a point of contention domestically and globally."

              "summary": "### Summary of Japanese Penal Code on Capital Punishment\n\n#### Penal Code Overview\nThe **Penal Code of Japan** (Act No. 45 of 1907) is the foundational legal document outlining criminal offenses and their respective penalties in Japan. Within this code, capital punishment is addressed at multiple points, indicating the severity of certain crimes and the possible use of the death penalty as a punishment.\n\n#### Legal Provisions\n1. **Execution Method**:\n   - As per **Article 11(1)**, the death penalty in Japan is executed by hanging within a penal institution.\n   - Individuals sentenced to death remain detained in jail until their execution.\n\n2. **Crimes Punishable by Death**:\n   - The penal code and related laws list 14 crimes eligible for the death penalty. However, this is primarily enforced for aggravated murder, cases involving multiple murders, or extremely heinous acts such as those involving torture, extreme brutality, or kidnap-for-ransom scenarios.\n   - Crimes such as instigating foreign aggression receive a mandatory death sentence.\n\n3. **Execution Statistics and Public Opinion**:\n   - Since 2000, Japan has executed 98 inmates, with the most recent execution being Tomohiro Katō, the Akihabara massacre perpetrator, in 2022.\n   - There are currently 107 inmates on death row awaiting execution.\n   - Public support for capital punishment remains high, with an estimated 80.8% of respondents in a 2019 poll supporting the death penalty.

However, it is primarily applied only for aggravated murder.\n\n**Execution Method**: The sole method of execution in Japan is long drop hanging. Executions are carried out in one of seven dedicated execution chambers located in major cities.\n\n**Application and Cases**: Death sentences are typically reserved for cases involving multiple murders. However, single murder cases involving extreme brutality, torture, or ransom demands can also result in a death sentence. Notably, the only crime with a mandatory death sentence under Japanese law is instigating foreign aggression.\n\n**Recent Executions and Death Row**: Since 2000, Japan has executed 98 inmates. The most recent execution was of Tomohiro Katō, the Akihabara massacre perpetrator, in July 2022. Currently, 107 inmates are awaiting execution.\n\n**Public Opinion**: Support for the death penalty remains high in Japan. A 2019 government survey indicated that 80.8% of respondents support it. Even with the theoretical alternative of life imprisonment without parole, over half still supported the death penalty.\n\n**Execution Procedure**: Execution by hanging involves prisoners being led to the gallows blindfolded, with their feet bound and hands cuffed. The mechanism's activation is anonymous, triggered by several officers pressing buttons simultaneously. This process aims to prevent any single officer from feeling responsible for the death.\n\n**Criticism and Challenges**: Japan’s execution system faces criticism for its secrecy and perceived cruelty. Prisoners often remain in solitary confinement for many years and are typically notified of their execution only hours before it occurs. Amnesty International and other critics argue this induces severe psychological distress.\n\n#### Historical Context: Edo Period Punishments\n\nIn the Edo period (1603–1868), Japan utilized a variety of punishments:\n\n1. **Capital Punishment**: Serious crimes like murder and arson were punishable by death. Execution grounds included Kozukappara, Suzugamori, and Itabashi, with a reported 100,000 to 200,000 executions at Kozukappara alone.\n2. **Incarceration and Exile**: Prison terms and exile were common forms of punishment.\n3. **Penal Labor**: Convicts were often sentenced to penal labor.\n4. **Confiscation of Property**: Criminals could have their property confiscated.\n5. **Corporal Punishment**: Physical punishment was also employed for various crimes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nJapan maintains a modern and historical practice of the death penalty through hanging, supported by a significant majority of the public but criticized for its secretive and psychologically harmful procedures. Historically, the Edo period also saw the application of capital punishment among a variety of other severe penalties."

Executions are carried out by long drop hanging in one of the seven execution chambers located across the country. Executions often follow prolonged periods, averaging 15 years on death row, despite a requirement that executions be scheduled within six months of a finalized death sentence.\n\n#### Public Opinion and Legal Framework\n- **Support for Death Penalty**: Support for capital punishment remains high among the Japanese public. A 2019 poll by the Cabinet Office revealed that 80.8% of respondents support the death penalty, although support decreases if life sentences without parole were made available.\n- **Legal Foundation**: Capital punishment is sanctioned for 14 offenses under Japan's Penal Code, though it is typically reserved for severe cases of murder involving multiple victims or extreme brutality.\n\n#### Recent Trends\n- **Temporary Pause in Executions**: In 2023, Japan did not conduct any executions, partly attributed to heightened international scrutiny as Japan presided over the G7, as well as internal political shifts, including the resignation of a justice minister who made controversial remarks about the death penalty. Despite the pause, Japan's strict protocols and solitary confinement conditions for death row inmates, including 24-hour surveillance and last-minute execution notifications, continue to draw criticism.\n\n### Key Points\n1. **Same-Day Execution Notification**: Legally challenged as psychologically torturous and unconstitutional.\n2. **International Criticism**: Amnesty International and the UN have condemned Japan’s secretive and mentally harrowing execution practices.\n3. **High Public Support**: Consistent public support, though it wavers under alternatives like life without parole.\n4. **Strict Solitary Confinement**: Death row inmates live in strict isolation with final execution notifications given just an hour in advance.\n5. **Execution Slowdown in 2023**: No executions in 2023 due to international scrutiny and political factors, though the legal and procedural framework remains unchanged.\n\nJapan’s death row conditions thus reflect a conflict between traditional support for capital punishment among its population and increasing domestic and international calls for more humane and transparent practices."

Recent surveys indicate strong support for maintaining the death penalty, though this support can vary significantly based on how questions are framed.\n\n#### Key Findings\n1. **High Levels of Support in Government Surveys:**\n   - A November 2019 opinion poll conducted by the Cabinet Office revealed that 80.8% of Japanese respondents believe the death penalty is necessary in some cases. The same poll found that only 9.0% think it should be abolished entirely.\n   - Support for the death penalty has consistently remained above 80% in similar surveys held every five years since 2004.\n\n2. **Bias in Survey Methodology:**\n   - Mai Sato's research pointed out the biases in government surveys, highlighting that the way questions are framed can significantly influence responses. For example, when respondents were asked if they support the death penalty without the option of life imprisonment without parole, over 80% answered positively. However, this support dropped to 38% when life imprisonment without parole was offered as an alternative.\n\n3. **Factors Influencing Public Opinion:**\n   - Those who support the death penalty often cite the need to honor victims' feelings and the belief that \"a life should be compensated with a life.\"\n   - Concerns about irreversible wrongful convictions are the most common reason cited by those opposing the death penalty.\n   - Comparative studies in other countries, like the United States, show similar trends where the framing of questions alters public opinion.\n\n4. **Abolition Efforts and International Criticism:**\n   - The Japan Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA) and various human rights groups have urged the Japanese government to abolish the death penalty or at least suspend it. Yet, these calls have met with resistance due to prevailing public opinion and specific political stances.\n   - International organizations, including Amnesty International, criticize Japan for maintaining the death penalty, and efforts for abolition have stronger traction globally, with 142 countries having abolished or suspended it by 2018.\n\n5. **Case Studies and Historical Context:**\n   - The French abolition of the death penalty in 1981 serves as an essential case study, illustrating that legislative changes can occur despite contrary public opinion.\n   - The death penalty's implementation in Japan includes high-profile cases such as the execution of Aum Shinrikyō cult leaders involved in the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack.\n\n### Conclusion\nPublic opinion in Japan shows strong support for the death penalty; however, this consensus is influenced significantly by survey design. Efforts by bar associations and human rights groups to challenge and abolish the death penalty face substantial hurdles due to entrenched public opinion and political resistance. Nonetheless, the debate continues amid ongoing international scrutiny and evolving legal discourses around capital punishment."

              "query": "Japanese public support for capital punishment",
              "summary": "Japanese public support for capital punishment remains notably high despite varying international trends. The Japan Cabinet Office's 2019 poll highlights this, revealing that only 9% of respondents supported abolishing capital punishment, while a significant majority of 80.8% were in favor. This level of support contrasts with trends in other countries where support for the death penalty is waning, such as in the UK where it fell below 50% for the first time.\n\nJapan's high support for capital punishment can be juxtaposed with recent data on executions. For instance, Japan did not carry out any executions in 2023 and imposed only three new death sentences, which was partly due to heightened international scrutiny and political turbulence, including the resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi. Despite these pauses, Japan still strictly adheres to its death penalty procedures, characterized by utmost secrecy and potential psychological stress for inmates, as lawsuits from death row inmates in 2021 have illustrated.\n\nCultural differences also play a role in the public perception of capital punishment in Japan compared to other countries, as shown by a study that compared public opinions between the UK and Japan. While a majority in both Japan and the UK support capital punishment, Japanese citizens are particularly resistant to the insanity defense, a stance linked to cultural perspectives on crime and punishment. This resistance aligns with traditional views that see capital punishment as a deterrent and a fair retributive measure.\n\nOverall, despite movements towards abolition or declining support in many countries, capital punishment continues to enjoy strong support within Japan, underscored by cultural factors and recent government data."

              "summary": "## Research Summary on Surveys Regarding the Death Penalty in Japan\n\n### Overview\nThe death penalty is a contentious issue globally, and Japan is no exception. Surveys and studies indicate significant support for capital punishment among the Japanese population. This summary highlights key insights from recent polls and studies on the public opinion and legal perspectives on the death penalty in Japan.\n\n### Public Opinion Polls\n### 1. Government and Independent Surveys\nSeveral surveys have consistently shown high support for the death penalty in Japan:\n\n- **2019 Cabinet Office Poll**:\n  - Conducted in November 2019, indicated that 80.8% of Japanese citizens support the death penalty, believing it is necessary in certain cases.\n  - The survey reached 3,000 adults and has been conducted every five years since 2004, consistently showing support above 80%.\n  - Only 9% favored the abolition of the death penalty.\n\n- **Longitudinal Trends**:\n  - Historical data from the Death Penalty Information Center also notes that public opinion has consistently favored the death penalty in Japan, with previous polls showing similar high levels of support.\n\n### Reasons for Support and Opposition\n- **Support for the Death Penalty**:\n  - The primary reason for supporting the death penalty is to honor the feelings of victims' families, cited by 56.6% of supporters in the 2019 poll.\n  - Other common reasons include beliefs in justice and deterrence of severe crimes.\n\n- **Opposition to the Death Penalty**:\n  - Among the 9% who oppose it, the most significant concern (50.7%) is the irreversible nature of wrongful convictions.\n  \n- **Impact of Life Without Parole**:\n  - If a life without parole system were introduced, 35.1% of respondents said the death penalty should be abolished, but 52% still favored retaining it.\n\n### Legal and Human Rights Perspectives\n### 2. International Obligations and Criticisms\n- **Death Penalty Project Report (2013)**:\n  - Examined Japan's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\n  - While the ICCPR does not prohibit the death penalty outright, it requires member countries to ensure fair trial standards and humane treatment of those sentenced to death — areas where Japan has faced criticism.\n  - The report mentions that public opinion polls showing high support might be influenced by factors such as media representation and lack of public awareness about wrongful convictions and human rights implications.\n\n### Execution Practices and International Context\n- Despite global trends towards abolishing the death penalty or limiting its use, Japan remains steadfast in its practice. For example, in 2018, Japan was one of only two Group of Seven (G7) countries to carry out executions, the other being the United States. Notably, Japan executed 15 individuals in 2018, 13 associated with the Aum Shinrikyō cult's 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe surveys and studies on the death penalty in Japan underscore a robust majority support for capital punishment among the population. While there are arguments both for and against the practice, a significant portion of the public supports it due to considerations for victims' families and beliefs in justice. However, there are ongoing international and domestic critiques related to human rights and legal standards which Japan is urged to address."

              "query": "Japanese societal views on death penalty",
              "summary": "### Japanese Societal Views on the Death Penalty\n\n#### Overview\n\nJapanese societal views on the death penalty reveal a complex landscape shaped by numerous factors, including cultural beliefs, moral intuitions, and political dynamics. The key aspects detailed in the query results include empirical data on support levels, the role of moral and emotive factors in public opinion, and the influence of political leadership in shaping death penalty discourse.\n\n#### Empirical Data and Comparative Views\n\n1. **Study on International Comparisons (ScienceDirect)**:\n   - **Death Penalty Support**: A study comparing death penalty views among college students in China, Japan, and the U.S. found that Japanese respondents reported moderate support, with Chinese students displaying the highest support levels, and U.S. students the lowest.\n   - **Deterrence and Retribution**: Japanese students believed in the deterrent value of capital punishment, which was a strong correlate of their views on the death penalty, closely followed by retribution.\n   - **Opposition Predictors**: The barbarity of executions was a significant predictor for opposing the death penalty among Japanese respondents, similar to their Chinese counterparts.\n\n2. **Opinion Poll (Nippon.com)**:\n   - **Support Levels**: An opinion poll conducted by the Cabinet Office in 2019 found that 80.8% of Japanese adults believe the death penalty is sometimes necessary, with continuous high levels of support since 2004.\n   - **Reasons for Support and Opposition**: Supporters primarily cite the consideration of victims' feelings (56.6%). In contrast, opponents highlight the irreversible nature of wrongful convictions (50.7%).\n   - **Life Sentencing Consideration**: If a system of life sentencing without parole were introduced, 52.0% of those surveyed still believe the death penalty should continue, whereas 35.1% advocate for its abolition.\n\n#### Moral Intuitions and Political Influence\n\n3. **Death Penalty and Democracy (SpringerLink)**:\n   - **Moral and Emotive Foundations**: Public opinion in Japan is deeply rooted in moral intuitions about retribution and atonement, making it resistant to rational discussion and debate (giron).\n   - **Political Leadership's Role**: Abolition or significant reform of the death penalty in Japan is more likely driven by political leadership rather than shifts in public perception. Historical instances show that political leaders have the power to affect significant changes in the death penalty discourse.\n   - **Notable Example**: Chiba Keiko, who served as Minister of Justice, exemplified this influence by authorizing executions despite her abolitionist stance, attracting significant attention and criticism, especially from fellow abolitionists.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nJapanese societal views on the death penalty are characterized by high levels of public support, driven by moral and emotive reasons that prioritize retribution and the victims' feelings. Despite a strong cultural inclination towards maintaining capital punishment, any potential shift towards abolition or reform is more likely to emanate from political leadership rather than a change in public opinion. This underscores the entrenched nature of the death penalty in Japanese society, shaped by a blend of cultural, moral, and political factors."

              "summary": "### Ethical Debates about the Death Penalty in Japan: Overview\n\nThe results summarize various aspects surrounding the ethical debates on the death penalty in Japan, highlighting both arguments for and against the practice, as well as providing insight into the cultural and legal context in which these debates occur.\n\n#### Arguments in Favor of the Death Penalty\n\n1. **Retribution**:\n   - Retribution is a fundamental argument positing that those guilty of heinous crimes deserve proportional punishment, which in the case of murder can mean a death sentence.\n   - It aligns with a commonly held sense of justice, which demands equivalence in punishment (\"an eye for an eye\").\n\n2. **Deterrence**:\n   - Proponents argue that the death penalty serves as a deterrent against grave crimes, as the fear of execution may prevent potential criminals from committing such acts.\n   - However, there is no definitive statistical evidence proving the efficacy of the death penalty in deterring crime more effectively than life imprisonment.\n\n3. **Prevention of Re-offending**:\n   - Execution ensures that convicted criminals cannot re-offend, thereby protecting society permanently.\n\n4. **Closure and Vindication**:\n   - It offers a sense of closure and justice to the victims' families.\n\n#### Arguments Against the Death Penalty\n\n1. **Value of Human Life**:\n   - Opposition views every human life as inherently valuable, arguing that even the worst offenders should not be deprived of their lives because of their crimes.\n\n2. **Right to Live**:\n   - The stance is grounded in human rights perspectives, contending that every person has an inalienable right to life, which the state violates by executing individuals.\n\n3. **Retribution vs. Vengeance**:\n   - Critics argue that the death penalty is more about vengeance than true justice or retribution.\n   - The anticipatory suffering of being on death row complicates the ethical landscape, as it can render the punishment more severe than just execution.\n\n4. **Execution of the Innocent**:\n   - The irrevocability of the death penalty is a primary concern given the potential for judicial errors. Innocent individuals may be wrongfully convicted and executed, as evidenced by exoneration cases in various countries.\n\n#### Japan-Specific Context\n\n1. **Constitutional Standing**:\n   - The Supreme Court of Japan upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty in 1948. Since then, executions have continued, albeit with periods of moratorium.\n\n2. **Public and Official Stance**:\n   - Despite exoneration cases and public scrutiny, official governmental stance, influenced by major political parties like the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has largely maintained support for the death penalty.\n   - The Japan Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA) has proposed replacing capital punishment with imprisonment without parole, suggesting a growing movement advocating for the abolition of the death penalty.\n\n3. **Heterogeneity in Debate**:\n   - The death penalty debate in Japan features a diverse array of actors, from government officials to human rights organizations. This diversity leads to a broad range of narratives and opinions, challenging the homogeneity perceived in public discourse.\n\n4. **Implementation Practices**:\n   - In Japan, the practice of informing the condemned of their execution just moments before it occurs adds an additional ethical dimension to the debate, raising questions about the cruelty and psychological impact on the prisoners.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ethical debates about the death penalty in Japan are multifaceted, involving retributive justice, deterrence, protection of society, human rights considerations, and potential judicial errors. The discussion remains contentious with strong arguments on both sides and an evolving public discourse influenced by legal precedents, political stances, and human rights advocacy."

Key concerns include the same-day notice of executions, prolonged solitary confinement, and general detention conditions for death row inmates.\n\n### Same-Day Notice of Executions\n\n1. **Lawsuit by Death-Row Prisoners (2021)**:\n   - Death-row inmates in Japan have sued over the practice of notifying prisoners about their execution on the day it is to occur. The lawsuit, filed in Osaka District Court, argues that this practice is inhumane, induces severe psychological distress, and contravenes Japan's constitution.\n   - It alleges that same-day notification provides inadequate time for legal recourse and calls for compensation for the emotional damages incurred.\n\n2. **Amnesty International's Condemnation**:\n   - Amnesty International labels Japan's execution procedures as \"shrouded in secrecy\" and condemns them as \"cruel, inhuman, and degrading.\" This secrecy includes not disclosing the execution date to the prisoners, leading to heightened mental distress.\n\n### Criticisms from United Nations\n\n1. **UN Human Rights Committee (2022)**:\n   - The UN Human Rights Committee, following a review of Japan's compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), criticized Japan for its persistent use of the death penalty without efforts towards abolition.\n   - The Committee highlighted concerns over the execution of prisoners while their retrial requests remain pending and criticized the lack of mandatory review systems for capital cases and inadequate monitoring of inmates' mental health.\n   - Prolonged solitary confinement and 24-hour video surveillance were noted as particularly problematic, alongside issues regarding inadequate medical services, lack of procedural guarantees, and discriminatory treatment of LGBT inmates.\n\n### Human Rights Watch Report (2023)\n\n- The report reiterates long-standing issues related to the death penalty in Japan, such as the same-day execution notifications and restricted access to legal counsel. In 2021 and 2022, multiple inmates were executed, with over 100 remaining on death row.\n- The broader human rights context in Japan includes insufficient protections against various forms of discrimination and the lack of a national human rights institution.\n\n### Impact and Recommendations\n\n- **International Scrutiny**: Japan faces continued pressure from international bodies to reform its death penalty practices to align with international human rights standards.\n- **Local Advocacy**: Both local and international human rights groups, including the Center for Prisoners’ Rights in Japan, continue to call for increased transparency and humane treatment of death-row inmates.\n\nIn summary, Japan's death penalty system remains highly controversial and criticized for its inhumane practices, opaque execution procedures, and failure to ensure the mental and legal well-being of death-row prisoners. The country faces robust international pressure to reform its practices and align with global human rights norms."

              "summary": "Amnesty International has been actively campaigning against the death penalty in Japan. Here are the main points derived from various sources regarding their stance and activities:\n\n1. **Recent Executions (2021)**:\n   - In December 2021, Japan executed three death row inmates: Yasutaka Fujishiro, Mitsunori Onogawa, and Tomoaki Takanezawa. These were the first executions since 2019.\n   - Amnesty International condemned these executions, describing them as a significant setback for human rights under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who had recently come to power.\n   - Amnesty highlighted the clandestine nature of executions in Japan, where prisoners are often given minimal notice, and families are informed post facto.\n\n2. **General Stance on the Death Penalty**:\n   - Amnesty International opposes the death penalty unconditionally, arguing that it is a gross violation of human rights.\n   - The organization emphasizes the global trend towards abolition, with over 100 countries having abolished the death penalty in law and practice. Japan, however, persists in retaining this punishment.\n\n3. **Historical Context**:\n   - A report from an Amnesty International mission highlights that, under Japanese law, the death penalty can be imposed for 17 offenses, but recent death sentences have typically been for murder, killings during robbery, and killings with explosives.\n   - Historical data shows that executions were sparse, with only one person executed annually in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n   - Amnesty has urged the Japanese government to cease all executions and commute existing death sentences as a step toward abolition.\n\n4. **Global Data (2021)**:\n   - Globally, Amnesty International recorded 579 executions across 18 countries in 2021, marking a 20% increase from the previous year but still the second-lowest figure in a decade.\n   - Japan, along with Belarus and UAE, resumed executions after a hiatus.\n   - Most executions occurred in countries like China, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, with China being the leading executioner, though exact numbers are state secrets.\n\n5. **Recent Trends and Recommendations**:\n   - Amnesty continues to recommend that Japan establish an official moratorium on executions as an initial move towards abolishing the death penalty.\n   - Emphasis is placed on informing the public about the lack of a special deterrent effect of the death penalty and discussing human rights and criminological issues associated with it.\n\nIn summary, Amnesty International remains vocal and active in its campaign to abolish the death penalty in Japan, criticizing recent executions, urging legislative changes, and aligning with global trends towards abolition."

Fujishiro had a personality disorder but was deemed criminally responsible. Onogawa was awaiting a decision on a retrial request, and Takanezawa had withdrawn an appeal which his lawyer unsuccessfully tried to reinstate.\n    - **Criticism**: Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, criticized the resumption, asserting it as a step back from global trends toward abolition. They noted the secrecy surrounding executions and called for a moratorium.\n\n2. **General Information on Capital Punishment in Japan (Wikipedia)**:\n    - **Legal Framework**: Japan's Penal Code lists 14 capital crimes, primarily applied to aggravated murder. The mandatory death sentence is only for instigation of foreign aggression.\n    - **Execution Process**: Executions are carried out by long drop hanging at seven locations across the country.\n    - **Criteria for Death Sentences**: Typically involve multiple murders or exceptionally grave single murders (e.g., involving torture or extreme brutality).\n    - **Recent Statistics**: Since 2000, 98 inmates have been executed.

Hakamada, who worked there, was arrested two months later.\n- **Conviction Issues**: Hakamada's confession was allegedly forced through torture. His case featured a lack of direct evidence and questionable key evidence produced nearly a year after the crime.\n- **Legal Developments**: Hakamada was released in 2014 following new DNA evidence that called his conviction into question. In March 2023, Tokyo High Court ordered a retrial, recognizing potential misconduct in the initial conviction. Amnesty International highlighted the importance of this retrial for justice.\n- **Support**: Hakamada's sister, Hideko, campaigned fervently for years. Amnesty International advocates for not appealing the retrial ruling, acknowledging faults in the original legal procedures.\n\n#### 2. **Execution of Tsukasa Kanda (Amnesty International)**\n- **Overview**: Tsukasa Kanda, convicted in 2009 for robbery and homicide, was executed in June 2015.\n- **Context**: Execution took place amid Japan's political focus on military role extension, suggesting an attempt to minimize public scrutiny.\n- **Criticism**: Amnesty International condemns the lack of debate on the death penalty's validity, criticizing the government's justification of executions as a crime deterrent without scientific backing.\n- **Execution Practices**: Criticisms include inadequate legal safeguards, lack of a mandatory appeal process, executions without prior notice, and questionable confessions obtained under duress.\n- **Global Context**: Japan remains one of the few G8 countries practicing capital punishment. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty unconditionally and calls for Japan to value human rights and end state-sanctioned executions.\n\n#### 3. **General Information on Capital Punishment (Wikipedia)**\n- **Definition**: Capital punishment or death penalty is the state-sanctioned execution of a person for a capital crime.\n- **Historical Context**: Execution methods have varied from beheading to hanging, shooting, lethal injection, electrocution, and gassing.\n- **Capital Crimes**: Common capital offenses include murder, assassination, mass murder, child murder, terrorism, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n- **Legal and Ethical Debates**: Capital punishment remains a highly controversial topic with ethical debates surrounding its implementation, especially concerning human rights and legal fairness.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe cases of Iwao Hakamada and Tsukasa Kanda highlight significant issues within Japan's capital punishment system, including wrongful convictions, forced confessions, and lack of transparency and adequate legal safeguards. Amnesty International and various human rights organizations criticize Japan's continued use of the death penalty, advocating for its abolition and the adoption of more humane and just practices."

              "summary": "### Infamous Criminals Executed in Japan: Research Overview\n\n#### Tokyo War Crimes Trial\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo War Crimes Trial, convened on April 29, 1946, to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes committed during World War II. This tribunal was similar to the Nuremberg Trials for Nazi war criminals. General Douglas MacArthur, acting as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, ordered the arrests of key Japanese suspects shortly after Japan's surrender in September 1945. Notable among those arrested was General Hideki Tojo. \n\nFrom May 3, 1946, to November 12, 1948, the trial examined 419 witnesses and analyzed 4,336 pieces of evidence. Altogether, 28 defendants, primarily military officers and government officials, were charged. Ultimately, seven individuals received death sentences via hanging, while 16 were given life imprisonment. The tribunal, comprising judges and prosecutors from 11 Allied countries, aimed at establishing accountability for wartime atrocities.\n\n#### Iva Toguri D'Aquino (\"Tokyo Rose\")\nIva Toguri D'Aquino, famously associated with the moniker \"Tokyo Rose,\" was an American-born woman of Japanese ancestry who made radio broadcasts from Japan during World War II. She was accused of treason for assisting Japanese propaganda. However, her case is unique as it relates more to propaganda activities rather than direct war criminal activities. The FBI has detailed an investigation into her life and the complexities surrounding the term \"Tokyo Rose.\"\n\n#### Modern Executions in Japan\nCapital punishment in Japan remains a legal consequence for severe crimes, like multiple murders or aggravated single killings. The mode of execution is hanging, and post a four-year moratorium, executions resumed in 1993. A notable post-1993 mass execution occurred in 2018 when 13 members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult were executed for their roles in the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack. Here are some examples of executed criminals from this period:\n\n1. **Seikichi Kondo**: Executed on March 26, 1993, for multiple murders.\n2. **Shujiro Tachikawa**: Executed at the age of 62 for multiple murders.\n3. **Yukio Seki**: Executed for a single murder.\n4. **Hideo Deguchi**: Executed at the age of 70 for multiple murders.\n5. **Kazumi Sasaki**: Executed for multiple murders.\n\n#### Conclusion\nJapan has a history marked by significant war crime trials and a robust contemporary capital punishment system. From the Tokyo War Crimes Trial to modern executions, the legacy of justice for grievous crimes persists. The Tokyo War Crimes Trial, in particular, underscores the international efforts to hold leaders accountable for wartime atrocities. More recently, the legal precedent for capital punishment has led to the execution of individuals involved in high-profile criminal activities, reflecting the nation's ongoing commitment to capital penalties for severe crimes."

              "summary": "### Overview of Executions in Japan\n\n#### Legal Framework and Practices\n- **Capital Punishment:** Japan retains capital punishment as a legal penalty, primarily applied for aggravated murder. The Penal Code lists 14 offenses as capital crimes, but executions are predominantly for severe murder cases, including instances involving torture, extreme brutality, or kidnapping with ransom demands.\n- **Method of Execution:** Executions are conducted by long drop hanging at one of seven execution chambers located in major cities across the country.\n- **Mandatory Death Sentence:** The only crime punishable by a mandatory death sentence is the instigation of foreign aggression.\n\n#### Recent Statistics and Trends\n- **Execution Count:** Since 2000, Japan has executed 98 inmates. As of the most recent data, Japan carried out one execution in 2022, that of Tomohiro Katō, responsible for the 2008 Akihabara massacre.\n- **2023 Pause:** There were no executions carried out in Japan in 2023. This year marked an unusual hiatus, leaving the United States as the only G7 country to administer capital punishment during this period.\n- **Death Row Inmates:** As of recent counts, there were 107 death row inmates in 2022, which slightly adjusted to 106 by the end of 2023 due to three prisoners dying on death row.\n\n#### Public and Judicial Sentiment\n- **Public Support:** Support for the death penalty remains high among the Japanese public. A 2019 poll revealed that 80.8% of respondents supported the continuation of capital punishment, with only 9% in favor of abolishing it. If life imprisonment without parole were introduced, 52.0% still supported the death penalty, compared to 35.1% supporting its abolition.\n- **Judicial Delays:** Legally, executions should be scheduled within six months of a finalized death sentence. However, in practice, inmates often spend around 15 years on death row due to prolonged reviews of their sentences.\n\n#### International and Domestic Controversies\n- **International Scrutiny:** Japan's role as a G7 presiding nation in 2023, along with controversies surrounding former Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi, who made insensitive remarks about his execution duties, could have contributed to the halt in executions.\n- **Conditions on Death Row:** Death row inmates are kept in solitary confinement with 24-hour surveillance and are only informed of their execution one hour before it takes place, which has been criticized as inhumane. This led to a 2021 lawsuit by inmates seeking to change this practice.\n\n#### Calls for Reforms\n- **Japan Federation of Bar Associations:** The organization advocates for enhanced roles for capital defense counsel and ultimately for the abolition of the death penalty, reflecting ongoing debates within Japan about capital punishment policies.\n\nIn conclusion, while Japan maintains strong public support for the death penalty, recent years have seen a decline in the number of executions, coupled with increasing international scrutiny and domestic controversies surrounding the practice and conditions on death row."

              "query": "death row population Japan",
              "summary": "The death row population in Japan is a significant yet controversial aspect of the country's criminal justice system. As of early 2023, Japan had approximately 106 to 112 prisoners on death row. The nation employs capital punishment for certain severe crimes, particularly aggravated murder, and executions are carried out by long drop hanging in one of seven designated execution chambers across the country.\n\nOne of the most contentious issues surrounding Japan's death penalty is the practice of providing same-day execution notices to prisoners, often resulting in extreme psychological trauma. This practice, criticized as inhumane and secretive, has led to lawsuits challenging its constitutionality. In November 2021, two death row inmates, supported by human rights organizations like Amnesty International, filed a lawsuit seeking to end same-day notifications and demanding compensation for emotional distress. Amnesty International has condemned this practice, citing it causes significant mental illness among prisoners who live in constant fear of sudden execution.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the Japanese public largely supports the death penalty. A 2019 poll revealed that 80.8% of respondents were in favor of maintaining capital punishment, although support for its abolition increases when life imprisonment without parole is considered as an alternative.\n\nFurthermore, in recent years, there have been fluctuations in the enforcement of this penalty. For instance, Japan did not perform any executions in 2023, making the U.S. the only G7 country to carry out capital punishment that year. This lack of executions highlights the complex and evolving nature of Japan's stance on the death penalty."

Prisoners receive notification only an hour before the execution, with their families and lawyers informed posthumously.\n   - On average, death row inmates spend around 15 years on death row due to extensive reviews of their sentences.\n\n3. **Historical Context & Trends**:\n   - Since 2000, Japan has executed 98 inmates, with high-profile cases including multiple murders and highly brutal acts.\n   - Three executions took place in December 2021 under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, resuming after a hiatus since 2019.\n\n4. **Public and Legal Scrutiny**:\n   - Despite advocacy efforts from the Japan Federation Bar Association for the abolition of the death penalty, public support remains high, with over 80% supporting it according to a 2019 poll.\n   - In 2021, two death row inmates filed a lawsuit claiming that the practice of last-minute execution notifications is unconstitutional and inhumane.\n   \n5. **International and Political Factors**:\n   - Japan faces international criticism for its use of the death penalty, with heightened scrutiny partly explaining the execution pause in 2023.\n   - The political landscape also affects execution scheduling. For instance, the resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022 created political challenges for his successor, Ken Saito, regarding the authorization of executions amidst other systemic issues like prison guard assaults.\n\n6. **Human Rights Perspective**:\n   - Organizations like Amnesty International have condemned Japan's persistence with the death penalty, labeling recent executions as indicative of a lack of progress on human rights.\n   - Globally, Japan is one of the few countries continuing regular executions, contrasting with the global trend toward abolition or moratoria on the death penalty.\n\nIn summary, Japan maintains a complex and contentious death penalty system characterized by procedural secrecy, lengthy legal reviews, substantial public support, and intermittent political and international pressure."
