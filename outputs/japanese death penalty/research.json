              "summary": "### History of the Death Penalty in Japan\n\n#### Overview\nJapan maintains capital punishment as a legal penalty, primarily for cases involving aggravated murder. The executions are carried out by long drop hanging at one of seven execution chambers located in major cities.\n\n#### Capital Crimes\nWhile Japan's Penal Code lists 14 capital crimes, in practice, the death penalty is applied almost exclusively for aggravated murder. Moreover, the most severe penalty, a mandatory death sentence, is reserved for the instigation of foreign aggression.\n\n#### Execution Trends\n- **Recent Executions**: Since 2000, there have been 98 executions, the most recent occurring on July 26, 2022, when Tomohiro Katō, the perpetrator of the Akihabara massacre, was executed. \n- **Current Status**: As of early 2024, Japan had 106 inmates on death row, with three inmates having died on death row in 2023. Notably, Japan did not carry out any executions in 2023, which meant that the U.S. was the only G7 nation to carry out executions that year.\n\n#### Public Opinion and Legal Requirements\nPublic support for the death penalty remains high in Japan. A 2019 poll indicated that 80.8% of respondents were in favor of its continuation. This support persists despite some movements within the Japan Federation Bar Association advocating for reforms and abolition.\n\n#### Administrative Practices and International Scrutiny\nExecution scheduling in Japan is highly secretive, with prisoners informed only one hour before the execution takes place. This practice has led to lawsuits claiming mental distress and unconstitutionality. \n\nIn 2023, political factors contributed to the halt in executions. Issues like the resignation of the Justice Minister in 2022 and controversies surrounding prison conditions impacted the scheduling of executions.\n\n#### Historical Methods\nJapan's historical use of the death penalty included various forms such as garrotting, beheading, and ritual forced suicide. These traditional methods have evolved into the current practice of hanging.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe Japanese death penalty system is characterized by a legal framework supporting capital punishment for grave crimes, strong public support, secretive execution practices, and occasional political and international pressures affecting its implementation."

              "summary": "The death penalty has a longstanding history in Japan and remains a legal form of punishment in the country today. Its historical roots can be traced back to ancient times, with the formalized legal system incorporating capital punishment since the establishment of the Penal Code of Japan. The current legal framework lists 14 capital crimes, but in practice, the death penalty is predominantly applied only for aggravated murder. Executions in Japan are carried out through the method of long drop hanging and are conducted in one of the seven execution chambers located in major cities across the nation. \n\nDespite the severity of this punishment, public support for the death penalty remains high. Polls conducted as recently as November 2019 by Japan's Cabinet Office indicate that approximately 80.8% of the population supports the continuation of the death penalty, whereas only 9% believe it should be abolished altogether. Even when considering the alternative of life imprisonment without parole, a significant majority still favored retaining the death penalty.\n\nIn terms of administrative practices, executions in Japan are notoriously secretive. Death-row inmates are kept in strict solitary confinement and are often given very little notice before their execution, sometimes notified only on the same day. This has drawn criticism and legal action from human rights advocates and the prisoners themselves, who argue that such practices contribute to severe psychological distress.\n\nAs of the latest information, there are currently 107 inmates on death row in Japan. The most recent execution was carried out on July 26, 2022, for Tomohiro Katō, perpetrator of the Akihabara massacre in 2008. Notably, in 2023, Japan conducted no executions, leaving the United States as the only G7 country to use capital punishment that year."

              "summary": "### Summary of the Evolution of Capital Punishment in Japan\n\nThe evolution of capital punishment in Japan has been marked by significant historical, legal, and cultural developments, some of which are detailed below based on the resources found.\n\n#### Historical Context\nCapital punishment in Japan has roots extending back to ancient times. Notably, Japan experienced a unique suspension of executions for several centuries towards the end of the first millennium. However, in the modern era, the death penalty is firmly established as a legal penalty.\n\n#### Legal Framework\n- **Capital Crimes:** The Penal Code of Japan lists 14 capital crimes, but in practice, the death penalty is predominantly applied for aggravated murder.\n- **Execution Method:** Executions are carried out by long drop hanging, a method conducted in one of seven execution chambers located in major cities across Japan.\n\n#### Recent Developments and Statistics\n- **Execution Statistics:** Since the year 2000, 98 inmates have been executed, with the most recent execution being that of Tomohiro Katō in July 2022, the perpetrator of the 2008 Akihabara massacre.\n- **Current Death Row:** As of the most recent data, there are 107 inmates awaiting execution.\n- **Renaissance of Capital Punishment:** Following a hiatus between 1989 and 1993, Japan witnessed a resurgence in the enforcement of capital punishment, with 39 executions taking place between 1993 and 2000.\n\n#### Public Opinion\n- **Support for Capital Punishment:** Public support for the death penalty remains high in Japan. A 2019 poll by the Japanese Cabinet Office indicated that 80.8% of respondents supported the death penalty, while only 9% believed it should be entirely abolished. When life imprisonment without parole was proposed as an alternative, 35.1% supported abolition while 52% still favored the continuation of the death penalty.\n\n#### Political and Social Influences\n- **Influence of Political Climate:** The application and discussion surrounding capital punishment in Japan are influenced by the political orientations of successive governments.\n- **Notable Cases:** High-profile cases, such as the trial of Shoko Asahara, the leader of the Aum cult, have brought significant attention to the death penalty. Asahara, found guilty, was ultimately sentenced to death, underscoring the ongoing relevance and application of the death penalty in Japan.\n\nIn conclusion, while Japan has a historical precedent of capital punishment, its modern implementation is marked by a blend of stringent legal practice, enduring public support, and periodic political influence, reflecting a complex interplay between historical roots and contemporary societal values."

However, Japan did impose three new death sentences.\n   - **Latest Execution:** The last execution occurred on July 26, 2022, involving Tomohiro Kato, who was convicted for the 2008 Akihabara massacre. Since 2000, a total of 98 inmates have been executed.\n\n2. **Legal and Procedural Aspects:**\n   - **Execution Scheduling:** According to Japanese law, the Justice Minister is required to schedule an execution within six months following the finalization of a death sentence. However, in practice, prisoners often spend about 15 years on death row while their sentences are reviewed.\n   - **Secrecy and Conditions:** Executions in Japan are carried out in strict secrecy. Death-sentenced prisoners are kept in solitary confinement, monitored continuously, and are informed of their execution just one hour before it occurs. Family and lawyers are notified only after the execution.\n\n3. **Public and Governmental Context:**\n   - **International Scrutiny and Political Impact:** In 2023, the lack of executions was partially attributed to the international scrutiny Japan faced as it presided over the G7, and the political difficulties following the resignation of the Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022.\n   - **Public Support:** High public support exists for the death penalty in Japan. A 2019 poll indicated that 80.8% of respondents supported the death penalty, although support dropped to 52% when life imprisonment without parole was considered as an alternative.\n\n4. **Human Rights and Legal Challenges:**\n   - **Lawsuits:** There have been legal challenges against the method of notifying prisoners about their execution, citing mental distress. In November 2021, two inmates sued the government, claiming the practice was unconstitutional and inhumane.\n\n**Key Locations and Execution Method:**\n\n- **Execution Chambers:** Executions are conducted via long drop hanging at one of the seven designated chambers across major Japanese cities.\n- **Crimes and Sentencing:** The death penalty in Japan is predominantly used for cases involving multiple murders, though extreme cases of a single murder could also result in a death sentence, especially if the crime involved brutality, torture, or kidnapping for ransom.\n\n**Death Row Statistics:**\n\n- **Current Death Row:** As of recent counts, there are 107 inmates awaiting execution on death row. \n\nThese key points provide a comprehensive overview of the death penalty's legal procedures, recent trends, public perception, and associated controversies in Japan."

The pause in Japan was influenced by several factors:\n  - **International Scrutiny**: Japan's presidency of the G7 in 2023 raised international attention.\n  - **Political Challenges**: The resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022, after controversial remarks about the death penalty, complicated the scheduling of executions for his successor, Ken Saito.\n\n#### Legal Framework and Practices\n- **Legal Basis**: Capital punishment is legally sanctioned under Japanese law, with the Penal Code listing 14 capital crimes. However, it is predominantly applied in cases of aggravated murder.\n- **Execution Method**: Executions are carried out by long drop hanging, typically in one of the seven execution chambers across Japan.\n- **Mandatory Death Sentence**: The only crime that mandates a death sentence is the instigation of foreign aggression.\n\n#### Death Row Conditions\n- **Secret Executions**: Japanese law mandates that executions be conducted in strict secrecy. Death-sentenced prisoners are kept in solitary confinement and monitored continuously.\n- **Notification Process**: Prisoners are informed of their execution just one hour before it occurs, which has been criticized by human rights organizations. Families and lawyers are notified post-execution.\n\n#### Public and Legal Responses\n- **Public Support**: Support for the death penalty remains high in Japan. A 2019 public poll showed 80.8% approval for the death penalty's continuation, though support drops to 52% if life imprisonment without parole is an alternate option.\n- **Legal Challenges**: In 2021, two death row inmates filed a lawsuit against the short-notice execution practice, citing mental distress and constitutional violations. The Osaka District Court dismissed the case in 2024, with plans for an appeal.\n\n#### Advocacy\n- **Japan Federation Bar Association**: This organization has been advocating for better capital defense counsel and the abolition of the death penalty. However, the societal and political landscape in Japan currently favors retentionist policies.\n\n### Summary\nJapan's death penalty system is characterized by its severe secrecy, with long periods on death row and a lack of advance notice for executions. While public support for the death penalty remains strong, international and domestic legal challenges continue to push for more humane and transparent practices. The temporary halt to executions in 2023 reflects a complex interplay of political concerns and international image, illustrating the ongoing debate over capital punishment in Japan."

The most recent execution was in July 2022 when Tomohiro Katō, the perpetrator of the Akihabara massacre, was executed.\n- **Death Row Population**: Currently, there are 106 individuals on death row. Inmates often spend an average of about 15 years on death row due to lengthly review processes.\n\n#### Public Opinion and Political Context\n\n- **Public Support**: Public support for the death penalty remains high. A 2019 poll by the Cabinet Office revealed that 80.8% of respondents supported the death penalty. When considering the introduction of life sentencing without parole, support for abolishing the death penalty increased to 35.1%, but a majority (52%) still favored its continuation.\n- **Political Factors**: The resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022, following controversial remarks about the death penalty, hindered the scheduling of executions in 2023. Additionally, Japan did not carry out any executions in 2023, possibly due to its presidency over the G7 and increased international scrutiny.\n\n#### Execution Conditions and Legal Challenges\n\n- **Secrecy and Solitary Confinement**: Executions are carried out in secrecy, with inmates being informed just one hour in advance. Death row prisoners are kept in strict solitary confinement under constant surveillance.\n- **Legal Challenges**: In 2021, a lawsuit was filed by two death row inmates claiming that the practice of notifying inmates of their execution on the day it is carried out is unconstitutional and inhumane. The Japan Federation Bar Association has also called for the abolition of the death penalty.\n\n#### International and Human Rights Perspectives\n\n- **Amnesty International Reports**: Amnesty International has highlighted the possibility of abolishing the death penalty amid low crime rates and upcoming penal code revisions. The organization recommends an immediate halt to executions and commutation of existing death sentences, emphasizing the lack of proven special deterrent effect of the death penalty.\n\nIn summary, while capital punishment remains legal and is actively supported by the public in Japan, it is primarily restricted to cases of aggravated murder. Recent years have seen fluctuating use of the death penalty influenced by political shifts and international scrutiny. Execution practices remain secretive, and there are ongoing legal and human rights challenges against the death penalty in Japan."

              "summary": "### Handling of Death Penalty Cases in the Japanese Legal System\n\n#### Structure and Process of the Judicial System\n- **Court System:**\n  - Japan has a hierarchical structure with five types of ordinary courts: Summary Courts, Family Courts, District Courts, High Courts, and the Supreme Court.\n  - Death penalty cases are generally initiated at the District Courts. In cases of serious crimes such as those potentially involving capital punishment, these cases are handled by three judges instead of a single judge.\n\n#### Trial and Sentencing\n- **Lay Judge System (Saiban-in System):**\n  - Complex and serious criminal cases, including those involving the death penalty, employ the lay judge system, wherein citizen judges participate alongside professional judges to deliberate and decide on cases.\n- **Capital Crimes:**\n  - The Japanese Penal Code lists 14 capital crimes, although the death penalty is predominantly applied in cases of aggravated murder.\n  - Executions are typically reserved for multiple murders or cases exhibiting extreme brutality (e.g., torture or kidnapping with a demand for ransom).\n\n#### Execution and Detention\n- **Execution Method:**\n  - Executions in Japan are carried out by long drop hanging, conducted in one of seven execution chambers located across the country, including the Tokyo Detention House.\n- **Execution Authorization:**\n  - The Justice Minister has the final authority over the implementation of death sentences.\n- **Death Row:**\n  - Inmates on death row are not classified as regular prisoners within the Japanese justice system. \n  - The period between sentencing and execution can be lengthy, with many inmates spending years on death row. \n\n#### Appeals and Clemency\n- **Appeals System:**\n  - Death sentences can be appealed, with the process moving up through High Courts and potentially to the Supreme Court.\n  - The High Court reviews appeals from both the defendant and the prosecution, who can request an increase in sentence.\n- **Clemency:**\n  - Inmates sentenced to death have the option to seek clemency, although this process is rarely successful.\n\n#### Public Sentiment\n- **Support for Death Penalty:**\n  - There is significant public support for capital punishment in Japan. A 2019 poll indicated that 80.8% of respondents favored retaining the death penalty.\n  - If life imprisonment without parole were introduced, support for abolishing the death penalty rises but still remains a minority view.\n\n#### Recent Data and Precedents\n- **Execution Statistics:**\n  - Since 2000, Japan has executed 98 inmates, with the most recent execution being undertaken in July 2022.\n- **Current Death Row Population:**\n  - As of recent data, there are 107 inmates on death row awaiting execution.\n\n### Summary\nThe Japanese legal system firmly integrates the death penalty within its judicial process, handling such cases with a structured hierarchy of courts and specific procedural safeguards involving multiple judges and lay participation. While the appeals process provides a mechanism for challenging death sentences, public consensus heavily favors the continuation of capital punishment, reflecting cultural and societal norms within Japan."

The Case of Hakamada Iwao:**\n- Hakamada Iwao, the world's longest-serving death row prisoner, was sentenced to death in 1968.\n- After spending 45 years on death row, mostly in solitary confinement, Hakamada was temporarily released in 2014 due to new DNA evidence that questioned his guilt.\n- Hakamada's original conviction was controversial, involving a confession he later recanted, claiming it was coerced through police brutality.\n- On March 13, 2023, the Tokyo High Court granted Hakamada a retrial, a decision that has been hailed as a step toward justice.\n- The retrial has been delayed by multiple appeals from prosecutors despite calls for expediency given Hakamada's advanced age.\n\n**2. The Japanese Judicial System:**\n- Japan operates a three-tiered judicial system comprising Summary Courts, Family Courts, District Courts, High Courts, and the Supreme Court.\n- High Courts handle appeals, and the Supreme Court is the final appellate body.\n- Serious criminal cases, including those eligible for the death penalty, are typically tried in District Courts, with appeals processed by High Courts and possibly the Supreme Court.\n\n**3. Death Penalty Practices in Japan:**\n- Executions are carried out by hanging and are conducted with high secrecy.\n- Death row inmates are informed of their execution only on the day it is to be carried out, and families are notified posthumously.\n- Amnesty International and other groups continue to advocate against the death penalty, citing issues such as forced confessions and lack of fair trials.\n\n**4. Recent Trends and Statistics:**\n- As of January 2024, Japan did not perform any executions in 2023, marking a significant year in which the United States was the only G7 country to conduct executions.\n- This pause in executions may signal shifting attitudes or increased scrutiny over capital punishment practices within the country.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Japanese Supreme Court and the broader judicial system continue to grapple with death penalty cases like Hakamada Iwao's, highlighting systemic issues related to coerced confessions and prolonged solitary confinement. The recent retrial ruling and the pause in executions in 2023 underscore ongoing debates and the potential for legal reforms within Japan's capital punishment framework."

              "summary": "## Overview of Execution Methods in Japan\n\n### Legal Framework\nCapital punishment remains a legal penalty in Japan, primarily enforced for aggravated murder. While the Japanese Penal Code lists 14 capital crimes, the death penalty is predominantly applied for severe crimes involving multiple murders, extreme brutality, or other aggravating factors.\n\n### Execution Method\nExecutions in Japan are carried out by long drop hanging, a method utilized since the late 19th century. This process involves the condemned individual being blindfolded, having their feet bound and hands cuffed, and being led to the gallows. A trapdoor mechanism beneath them is triggered by multiple prison officers simultaneously pressing buttons in an adjacent room, ensuring that no single officer knows who initiated the execution. This method, while meant to minimize individual responsibility among the officers, has been criticized for the potential of botched executions.\n\n### Secrecy and Psychological Impact\nExecutions are performed in utmost secrecy, with death row inmates often informed only an hour before their execution. This sudden notice system has been described as psychologically cruel, leading to significant mental distress due to the uncertainty of execution timing. Inmates spend extended periods—often decades—in solitary confinement, monitored constantly by surveillance. Legal challenges against this practice have been raised, with arguments it constitutes inhumane treatment.\n\n### Public and Political Context\nJapanese public opinion strongly supports the death penalty. Surveys indicate that around 80% of the population views the death penalty as necessary, with reasons often tied to vindicating victims' families. Activists and some legal organizations, such as the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, have called for greater transparency and a move towards abolition, though substantial public backing for capital punishment poses a significant hurdle to such reforms.\n\n### Recent Trends and Notable Cases\nFrom 2000 to 2023, Japan executed 98 inmates. The last recorded execution occurred in July 2022, involving Tomohiro Katō, the perpetrator of the Akihabara massacre. Noteworthy executions include the hanging of Shoko Asahara and 12 members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult responsible for the 1995 sarin gas attacks.\n\n### International Comparisons and Current Status\nJapan and the United States are the only G7 countries retaining the death penalty. Despite no executions being carried out in Japan in 2023, the country still maintains a significant death row population. Criticism of Japan’s capital punishment system persists, particularly regarding its secrecy and the psychological toll on inmates awaiting execution.\n\n### Legal and Social Debates\nOngoing debates in Japan focus on the ethical implications of execution methods, the psychological impact on inmates, and the overall need for a comprehensive public discourse on the future of the death penalty. The resignation of Japan's Justice Minister in 2022 amid controversy over remarks about executions exemplifies the complex political landscape surrounding this issue."

It is carried out exclusively by long drop hanging at one of the seven designated execution chambers located in major cities, such as the Tokyo Detention House.\n\n#### Legal Context\n- **Applicable Crimes**: Japan’s Penal Code lists 14 capital crimes, however, the death penalty is primarily applied to aggravated murder cases, particularly those involving multiple murders.\n- **Mandatory Death Sentence**: The only crime with a mandatory death penalty is the instigation of foreign aggression.\n- **Judicial Procedures**: Once a death sentence is finalized, prosecutors apply to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) for the execution order. Legally, executions should be carried out within six months of the finalized verdict, though in practice, inmates often spend years in solitary confinement.\n\n#### Execution Method and Process\n- **Hanging**: The method has been exclusively hanging for about 150 years. During an execution, convicts are blindfolded, their feet bound, and hands cuffed. Multiple officers simultaneously press buttons to trigger a trapdoor mechanism without knowing which button activates it.\n- **Mental Strain**: Execution duties impose enormous mental strain on corrections officers due to the procedural and psychological weight they carry. Teams of around 15 specially trained officers manage the process.\n\n#### Public Opinion and Statistics\n- **Public Support**: There is strong public support for the death penalty. A 2019 survey showed that 80.8% of Japanese adults support its continuation, while 9% advocate for its abolition. Support decreases slightly (to 52%) if life sentencing without parole is introduced.\n- **Recent Executions**: Since 2000, there have been 98 executions, including high-profile cases like the Akihabara massacre perpetrator Tomohiro Katō in 2022. As of late 2022, 107 inmates remain on death row.\n\n#### Controversies and Criticisms\n- **Secrecy and Timing**: Critics, including Amnesty International, highlight the secrecy and psychological trauma due to last-minute notifications given to inmates, usually just hours before their execution. This system has led to legal challenges by some death-row inmates.\n- **Public Discourse**: Activists call for more transparency and public discussion on the death penalty, criticizing the limited information provided by authorities.\n\n#### Historical and Recent Contexts\n- **High-Profile Executions**: Significant cases include the 2018 executions of the Aum Shinrikyo cult members responsible for the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack. Executions often occur after major public incidents, suggesting a response pattern to societal pressures.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe execution process in Japan is a complex intersection of legal procedures, public opinion, and ethical debates. While strong public support sustains its practice, the method and secrecy surrounding executions draw significant criticism from human rights organizations and activists."

              "summary": "### Life on Death Row in Japan\n\n#### Daily Conditions and Isolation\nPrisoners sentenced to death in Japan undergo extremely restrictive conditions. They are placed in solitary confinement and are under constant surveillance. Physical activities are severely limited; prisoners cannot make noise, walk around their cell, or even look around during the day. This absence of activity and prolonged isolation leads to significant mental and physical health deterioration over time. \n\n#### Communication and Visits\nDeath row inmates may receive visits from close family members, but these interactions are tightly controlled and monitored. Mail correspondence is subject to censorship. Due to the stigma and stress associated with having a relative on death row, many prisoners experience disconnection or abandonment by their families.\n\n#### Day-of-Execution Notification\nA distinctive practice in Japan is that prisoners are informed of their execution on the same day it is to be carried out, typically just hours before it happens. This practice has been criticized as psychologically torturous, as inmates live in constant fear, never knowing which day will be their last. The sudden notification leaves little time for any last-minute legal challenges or personal mental preparation, contributing to severe mental distress.\n\n#### Legal and Human Rights Concerns\nJapan’s practice of same-day execution notices and the secrecy surrounding execution procedures have been condemned by various human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Council. These organizations argue that the lack of transparency and the conditions under which inmates are held amount to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.\n\n#### Case Studies and Historical Context\nHistorical cases, like that of Iwao Hakamada, a former professional boxer who has been on death row for decades, highlight the severe and often contentious nature of Japan's death penalty system. As of the end of 2004, there were 118 inmates on death row, many awaiting execution without prior notice. Hakamada’s case, and others like it, underscore ongoing debates about the fairness and application of the death penalty in Japan, especially in light of modern forensic advancements that have exonerated death row inmates in other countries.\n\n#### Broader Context and International Relations\nJapan remains one of the few developed countries that still employs the death penalty. This stance has subjected it to international criticism, including unfavorable resolutions from the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Nevertheless, Japan maintains that its use of the death penalty is a sovereign right tailored to its crime-fighting needs, resisting foreign pressure to abolish the practice.\n\nOverall, life on death row in Japan is characterized by extreme isolation, psychological torment due to unpredictable executions, and significant scrutiny from international human rights bodies."

Some prisoners develop severe mental health issues due to the uncertainty and psychological torture associated with the same-day execution notice.\n\n3. **Living Conditions:**\n   - Death row inmates are kept in strict solitary confinement under continuous video surveillance.\n   - Their daily lives are highly restricted; they cannot make noise, walk around their cells, or engage in any activities.\n   - They have limited access to visitors and family, with visits heavily monitored and mail subject to censorship.\n   - Prisoners do not have access to computers or printers, which hampers their ability to build defenses for their legal cases effectively.\n   - The harsh living conditions lead to a serious deterioration in both mental and physical health over time.\n\n4. **Legal and Judicial Context:**\n   - A lay judge system implemented in 2009 has led to an increase in death sentence convictions.\n   - Sentences take an average of about 15 years to be reviewed, despite a legal requirement for executions to be scheduled within six months of a finalized death sentence.\n   - The Japanese Federation Bar Association advocates for greater involvement of capital defense counsel and calls for the abolition of the death penalty, though public support for the death penalty remains strong.\n\n5. **Global and Domestic Reactions:**\n   - Japan’s execution practices have faced significant international scrutiny and condemnation, including from the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n   - Political factors, such as the resignation of justice ministers and domestic scandals, have influenced the scheduling and execution of death sentences.\n\nThese findings reveal a complex interplay of legal, psychological, and societal elements that characterize the conditions for death row inmates in Japan, highlighting issues of human rights and judicial practices."

              "summary": "The treatment of death row prisoners in Japan has garnered significant criticism and legal challenges due to its highly secretive and psychologically harsh procedures. Here's a detailed summary of the key points from the provided sources:\n\n1. **Same-Day Execution Notice**:\n   - Japan's practice of notifying death row prisoners of their execution on the same day it's carried out is a major point of contention. A lawsuit filed in Osaka District Court in November 2021 by two Japanese death row prisoners alleges that this practice is “inhumane” and unconstitutional. The prisoners argue that the lack of notice prevents them from contacting their lawyers to file last-minute appeals and inflicts severe psychological trauma, as they live in constant fear that each day may be their last.\n\n2. **Psychological Impact**:\n   - Amnesty International and other human rights groups have continually condemned Japan’s execution procedures for being \"shrouded in secrecy.\" Reports indicate that the uncertainty and isolation lead to significant mental health issues, including severe mental illness. Prisoners live with the constant stress of potentially facing their execution at any moment without adequate time to mentally prepare, leading to what some describe as a form of psychological torture.\n\n3. **Conditions on Death Row**:\n   - Death row inmates in Japan face extremely restrictive conditions. According to a 2009 Amnesty International report, prisoners are kept in isolation with minimal movement allowed and limited physical exercise. Communication with the outside world, including family and lawyers, is highly restricted, contributing to their detrimental mental health conditions.\n\n4. **International Criticism**:\n   - Japan’s execution practices have been criticized by several international bodies. The U.N. General Assembly added an anti-secrecy provision to its resolutions, emphasizing that transparency is crucial for ensuring compliance with international human rights standards.\n   - A resolution by the U.N. Human Rights Council in October 2021 called on countries practicing the death penalty to end secretive executions and improve transparency.\n\n5. **Public Support and Legal Framework**:\n   - Despite the criticism, there is notable public support for capital punishment in Japan. Surveys conducted have consistently shown high levels of support, with around 80.8% of respondents favoring the continuation of the death penalty as of a 2019 poll by the Cabinet Office.\n   - Japan’s Penal Code lists 14 capital offenses, though it is primarily applied for aggravated murder. Executions are carried out by long drop hanging at seven execution chambers in major cities.\n\n6. **Recent Execution Statistics**:\n   - Since 2000, 98 inmates have been executed in Japan. There are currently 107 inmates on death row, with the most notable recent execution being Tomohiro Katō, who was executed in July 2022 for the Akihabara massacre.\n\nIn summary, the treatment of death row prisoners in Japan is marked by severe secrecy, psychological stress due to the unpredictability of execution timing, and strict isolation, leading to significant mental health issues. Despite international and domestic criticism, capital punishment continues to enjoy widespread public support and remains a legal penalty for severe crimes in Japan."

              "summary": "### Overview of Detention Conditions for Death Row Inmates in Japan\n\nDetention conditions for death row inmates in Japan have been a subject of significant human rights concern. Several sources, including reports from human rights organizations and accounts from former inmates, paint a grim picture of life on death row in the country.\n\n#### Solitary Confinement and Mental Health\nDeath row prisoners in Japan are typically subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, which can last for decades. This isolation is compounded by severe restrictions on movement and communication:\n- **Constant Surveillance:** Inmates are under 24-hour surveillance, which includes video monitoring.\n- **Inactivity:** They are not permitted to engage in any meaningful activities. They are restricted from making noise, walking around their cells, or interacting with others. Such conditions have been reported to severely deteriorate their mental and physical health.\n- **Censorship:** Mail correspondence is heavily censored, and visits are rare and closely monitored.\n\nExamples include the cases of Hakamada Iwao, who spent over 45 years in solitary confinement leading to severe mental illness, and Matsumoto Kenji, who also suffered significant mental decline under these conditions.\n\n#### Execution Notifications and Legal Proceedings\n- **Execution Procedures:** Prisoners are often informed of their execution on the day it is scheduled to be carried out, adding to the psychological torment.\n- **Legal and Medical Oversight:** There is notable concern about the lack of a mandatory system of review for capital cases and the absence of an independent body to monitor the mental health of inmates. There also appear to be insufficient procedural guarantees, such as access to legal counsel and medical services.\n\n#### International Criticism and Human Rights Reports\nInternational human rights organizations and bodies such as the UN Human Rights Committee have criticized Japan's treatment of death row inmates. Key findings and recommendations include:\n- **Abolition Calls:** Urging Japan to abolish the death penalty or at least limit the number of capital crimes to those involving the \"most serious crimes.\"\n- **Better Oversight:** Recommendations for better oversight of the mental health of death row inmates and the establishment of independent monitoring mechanisms.\n- **Treatment of Minority Groups:** Calls to ensure fair treatment of all prisoners, including LGBT inmates, and reviewing practices such as solitary confinement for transgender inmates.\n\n#### Challenges and Calls for Reform\nDespite periodic international outcries and some high-profile cases highlighting flaws in the system (e.g., Hakamada Iwao's case), substantial reforms have been slow:\n- **Resistance to Change:** Japanese authorities have demonstrated a consistent reluctance to abolish the death penalty or significantly alter the conditions on death row, maintaining that the current system is justifiable and necessary.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe conditions faced by death row inmates in Japan are extremely harsh, characterized by severe isolation, lack of activity, and minimal interaction with the outside world. These conditions have significant negative impacts on inmates' mental and physical health. Despite international criticism and calls for reform, changes have been limited, and the Japanese government continues to uphold the capital punishment system largely unchanged."

Despite international criticism and advocacy for abolition, a substantial portion of the Japanese population supports the continuation of the death penalty.\n\n#### Survey Results and Findings\n1. **Government Survey (2009)**:\n   - A 2009 government survey revealed that 86% of Japanese citizens who expressed an opinion were in favor of the death penalty. \n\n2. **Cabinet Office Poll (November 2019)**:\n   - This poll indicated that only 9.0% of respondents advocated for the abolition of the death penalty.\n   - Conversely, 80.8% believed that the death penalty is necessary.\n   - The Cabinet Office surveys public opinion on this issue every five years, and since 2004, over 80% of respondents have consistently opposed abolition.\n\n3. **Reasons for Support**:\n   - Key motivations for supporting the death penalty include the feelings of victims and their families, the belief that life should be compensated with life, and concerns that violent crime would increase if the death penalty were abolished.\n   - Many supporters fear that if criminals are not executed, they might reoffend.\n\n4. **Reasons for Opposition**:\n   - Among those advocating for abolition, significant reasons include the irreversibility of wrongful convictions, the belief in rehabilitation, and the view that capital punishment is inherently barbaric.\n   - Opponents argue that life imprisonment without parole is a more humane and effective means of ensuring justice and public safety.\n\n#### Political and Legal Context\n- The Japanese government, particularly the Ministry of Justice, maintains a firm stance against abolishing the death penalty.\n- Japan has not ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which aims at abolishing the death penalty. This position aligns with the prevalent public opinion favoring the retention of capital punishment.\n\n#### Advocacy and International Perspective\n- The Japan Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA) and international organizations like Amnesty International continue to advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in Japan.\n- Critics highlight Japan as an outlier among developed nations, where the global trend is towards abolishing or suspending the death penalty.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPublic opinion in Japan strongly favors the death penalty, a fact reflected in consistent survey results over the years. This widespread support influences the government's stance and contributes to Japan's resistance to international calls for abolition. While advocacy efforts persist, the prevailing public mindset underscores a significant challenge for reformers."

However, in practice, prisoners often spend an average of 15 years on death row.\n     - Political complications, including the resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022 due to controversial remarks, have affected the scheduling of executions.\n\n3. **Public Opinion**:\n   - **High Support for Capital Punishment**:\n     - A significant portion of Japanese citizens remain supportive of capital punishment. A record 85% of the population favored the death penalty in previous years.\n     - Support for the insanity defense, however, is much lower in Japan compared to the UK, likely influenced by cultural factors.\n\n4. **Comparative Studies**:\n   - **International Survey**:\n     - A comparative study between Japan and the UK revealed a higher affirmation for capital punishment among Japanese citizens.\n     - The survey highlighted that while the majority of people in both countries support the death penalty, Japanese citizens are generally less accepting of the insanity defense.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Debates**:\n   - **Secrecy and Prisoner Treatment**:\n     - Executions in Japan are carried out in utmost secrecy, with prisoners being informed just one hour before their sentences are enacted. This has sparked debates about the constitutionality and humanity of such practices, with legal challenges being filed by death row inmates.\n     - The Japan Federation Bar Association has called for the abolition of the death penalty and advocated for increased involvement of capital defense counsel.\n\n6. **Historical and Cultural Perspectives**:\n   - **Long-term Trends**:\n     - While other G7 countries have moved towards abolition, Japan's legal and cultural environment maintains strong public support for capital punishment.\n     - Cultural values and historical precedents play significant roles in the public's perception of the death penalty as a necessary deterrent and form of retribution.\n\n### Conclusion\nJapanese citizens' strong support for capital punishment contrasts markedly with the rapidly declining support in other G7 countries like the UK. Despite internal and external pressures leading to a pause in executions, the overall sentiment in Japan continues to favor the death penalty, underscored by legal, cultural, and historical factors."

According to a poll conducted by the Cabinet Office in 2019, 80.8% of respondents felt that the death penalty is sometimes necessary. This high level of support has been consistent over time, with support continuously topping 80% in polls since 2004.\n   - Only a small minority (9.0%) believes the death penalty should be abolished in all cases.\n\n2. **Reasons for Support:**\n   - The primary reason given by supporters is the consideration of victims' feelings, with 56.6% pointing to this justification. This suggests a deep-rooted belief in retributive justice.\n   - There is also an argument that the death penalty acts as a deterrent and is necessary for the punishment of the worst crimes.\n\n3. **Opposition and Concerns:**\n   - Those who oppose the death penalty (50.7% of opponents) cite the irrevocable nature of the punishment in the case of judicial errors as a major concern.\n\n4. **Political Context and International Comparison:**\n   - The continuation of the death penalty is sometimes attributed to Japan's political landscape.

This action underscores the enduring application of the death penalty in Japan.\n\nIn summary, while there is a substantial and consistent majority support for the death penalty among Japanese people, driven largely by victim's rights and retributive justice considerations, there is also a notable minority concerned with the potential for irreversible mistakes. The political use of public opinion to justify its retention adds another layer of complexity to the issue."

Here are some key points based on the research:\n\n### **Same-Day Execution Notification**\n- **Lawsuit by Death-Row Inmates**: Two Japanese death-row prisoners filed a lawsuit challenging the practice of same-day execution notification. The lawsuit, filed on November 4, 2021, in Osaka District Court, argues that this practice is inhumane and unconstitutional. The plaintiffs are seeking to end this practice and claim compensatory damages for emotional distress.\n- **Mental Toll**: The abrupt notification is said to provide no time for prisoners to contact their lawyers for last-minute legal challenges and causes significant psychological distress, described as tantamount to torture. Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned this practice.\n- **International Criticism**: The practice has been criticized in U.N. human rights resolutions, with calls for greater transparency and humane treatment in alignment with international standards.\n\n### **UN Review and Findings**\n- **UN Human Rights Committee's Critique**: In its 2022 Concluding Observations, the UN Human Rights Committee expressed deep concerns over Japan's failure to make progress toward abolishing the death penalty. This review highlighted several issues, including:\n  - **Prolonged Solitary Confinement**: Many death-row prisoners face long-term solitary confinement, sometimes lasting decades, which severely affects mental health.\n  - **Lack of Procedural Guarantees**: Issues like the absence of a mandatory review system for capital cases and the lack of independent monitoring of prisoners' mental health were noted. Executions have even been carried out while requests for retrials were pending.\n  - **Intrusive Surveillance**: The continuous 24-hour video surveillance and inadequate medical services for death row inmates were criticized.\n\n### **US State Department Report**\n- **Government Practices on Execution**: According to the 2022 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices by the U.S. Department of State, Japan's policy of same-day execution notice ostensibly aims to spare inmates the anguish of knowing their execution date. However, this practice has been criticized for its extremely adverse psychological impacts.\n- **Solitary Confinement and Living Conditions**: Death row inmates are held in solitary confinement with limited visitation rights. There's a noted deficiency in medical and mental healthcare, and facilities often have inadequate heating in winter and cooling in summer.\n\n### **Overall Impact and Recommendations**\n- **Human Rights Violations**: Japan's death penalty practices, particularly the lack of advance notice for executions, prolonged solitary confinement, and inadequate healthcare, violate several international human rights standards.\n- **Calls for Abolition**: Various human rights bodies and organizations recommend Japan abolish the death penalty or at least significantly reform its procedures to ensure transparency, adequate legal protections, and humane treatment.\n\nIn summary, Japan's death penalty system is widely criticized for its secrecy, inadequate legal processes, and severe psychological toll on inmates, drawing significant international human rights concerns."

              "summary": "### Summary of International Views on Japanese Capital Punishment\n\n**1. Japan Performed No Executions in 2023**\n\n- **Retentionist Stance**: Japan and the United States are the only two retentionist countries in the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialized democracies. Although Japan did not carry out any executions in 2023 and only imposed three new death sentences, the country still maintains its retentionist stance.\n- **Factors Behind the Pause**:\n  - **International Scrutiny**: Japan presided over the G7 in 2023, which may have led officials to pause executions to avoid heightened international criticism.\n  - **Political Issues**: The resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022 following controversial remarks he made about the death penalty made it politically challenging for his successor, Ken Saito, to authorize executions.\n  - **Prison System Issues**: Allegations of prisoner assault by guards and cabinet changes in 2023 contributed to deprioritizing the scheduling of executions.\n- **Execution Protocol**: Executions must be scheduled within six months of a finalized death sentence, but prisoners average about 15 years on death row. Execution procedures are kept extremely secretive, with prisoners informed only an hour before their execution.\n- **Public and Legal Pushback**: Despite the general support for the death penalty, the Japan Federation Bar Association has been advocating for its abolition and better defense counsel in capital cases. Two death row inmates filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the secretive execution process.\n\n**2. International Comparison Study (UK and Japan)**\n\n- **Public Opinion**: A comparative e-survey revealed that Japanese citizens are more affirmative towards capital punishment compared to their UK counterparts. A majority of Japanese and nearly half of UK respondents support the death penalty.\n- **Insanity Defense**: Japanese citizens largely oppose the insanity defense, contrasting with the more accepting attitude in the UK. Cultural factors play a significant role in this divergence.\n- **Perceptions and Justifications**: Supporters of capital punishment in both countries often believe in its deterrent effect and view it as a proportionate form of retribution within the penal system. \n\n**3. Death Penalty Information Center**\n\n- **Public Support in Japan**: Japanese public opinion heavily favors the death penalty, with a record 85% in support.\n- **UK Trends**: Support for the death penalty in the UK has fallen below 50% for the first time. This decline has been consistent over the years, reflecting a broader international trend away from capital punishment.\n- **Other Countries**: The data includes various countries' shifting views on capital punishment, showing that while some still support it under certain conditions (e.g., terrorist acts in Australia), others have decreasing or divided public opinions (e.g., France, Mexico, and Finland).\n\n### Conclusion\nJapan remains one of the few developed nations that retain the death penalty, alongside the United States in the G7. Public opinion within Japan heavily favors it, although numerous domestic and international factors have led to pauses or changes in its implementation. Comparative studies with countries like the UK highlight cultural and systemic differences in the acceptance of capital punishment and related legal defenses, thus offering insights into the diverse global perspectives on this contentious issue."

              "summary": "### Summary: NGO Reports on Death Penalty in Japan\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n1. **Solitary Confinement and Execution Procedures:**\n   - **Solitary Confinement:** Death row inmates in Japan are typically subjected to prolonged periods of solitary confinement with limited opportunities for physical movement and exercise.\n   - **Execution Notification:** Inmates are not informed of their execution date until the day it is carried out, and family members are informed only after the execution. The government maintains that this policy reduces the psychological anguish of the inmates.\n\n2. **International Scrutiny:**\n   - **Human Rights Records:** The reports, including those by the U.S. State Department and the Human Rights Committee, indicate concerns over Japan’s handling of death row inmates, particularly regarding solitary confinement and the procedures surrounding execution notifications.\n   - **Human Rights Committee's Dialogue:** In October 2022, during Japan's seventh periodic report review, the Human Rights Committee called Japan’s treatment of death row inmates \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading.\" They scrutinized issues such as the denial of executions for inmates with pending retrials and the overall conditions of death row confinement.\n\n3. **NGO Concerns:**\n   - **Retrial Process:** NGOs expressed significant concerns regarding the execution of inmates with pending retrial petitions. There is no legal requirement in Japan to stay an execution if a retrial petition is pending, posing risks of wrongful executions.\n   - **Prison Conditions:** Reports highlight that some prisons lack adequate facilities, including sufficient medical and mental health care, and proper heating and cooling systems. Prison conditions, overall, met international standards but had areas needing improvement.\n\n**Specific Reports:**\n\n1. **2022 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Japan**\n   - **Key Issues:** Besides issues related to the death penalty, the report touched upon broader human rights issues like reproductive health barriers, violence targeting marginalized groups, and ill treatment in detention centers. Specific to death penalty practices, concerns were raised about the solitary confinement conditions for death row inmates and the lack of prior notification about execution dates.\n\n2. **2021 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Japan**\n   - **Similar Themes:** The report echoed similar concerns from the 2022 report, emphasizing inadequate prison conditions and the solitary confinement of death row inmates. The information about execution dates being withheld until the day of execution was reiterated, with the government justified this practice as a means to reduce inmate anguish.\n\n3. **Human Rights Committee Review (Oct 2022)**\n   - **Treatment of Prisoners:** This session included discussions on numerous human rights issues, notably the remaining use of the death penalty and associated practices. The NGO submissions highlighted the use of the death penalty, the stringent solitary confinement rules, and the government's policy on execution notifications.\n   - **Government Response:** The Japanese delegation acknowledged the continuation of the death penalty for particularly heinous crimes and noted that the Ministry of Justice reviews all convictions for potential retrials or pardons to prevent wrongful executions. The delegation also stated that death row inmates receive counseling and can have visits from family members and lawyers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNGO reports scrutinizing Japan's use of the death penalty uniformly highlight serious concerns about the treatment of death row inmates, particularly regarding their mental and physical well-being due to protracted solitary confinement and last-minute execution notifications. These concerns have been consistently raised by international bodies, pointing towards significant room for policy and procedural reforms in Japan's criminal justice system."

A 2019 poll indicated that 80.8% of respondents supported its continued use.\n- **Alternative Sentences:** When asked about life sentencing without parole, support for the death penalty dropped, with 35.1% favoring abolition under this condition.\n\n#### Political and Legal Context:\n- **2023 Suspension Reasons:**\n  - Japan’s role as the G7 presidency in 2023 led to heightened international scrutiny.\n  - The resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022 due to a controversial remark about executions made it politically sensitive for his successor to authorize them.\n  - Additional complications included revelations of prisoner abuse and cabinet changes.\n\n#### Advocacy and Human Rights Perspective:\n- **Amnesty International's Stance:** Strong opposition to the death penalty. They have called for a moratorium on executions, labeling the practice as cruel and inhumane. Notably, the organization criticized the execution of three inmates on December 21, 2021, as a missed opportunity for human rights progress under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n- **Japanese Bar Association:** Advocacy for capital defense and complete abolition of the death penalty.\n\n#### Specific Cases:\n- **Executions on December 21, 2021:**\n  - Three inmates hanged: Yasutaka Fujishiro (killed seven relatives), Mitsunori Onogawa, and Tomoaki Takanezawa (both convicted of two murders).\n  - Fujishiro had a personality disorder but was deemed criminally responsible.\n  - Controversies included pending retrial requests and appeal withdrawals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe recent data and context on executions in Japan reveal a complex scenario where public support, political sensitivity, and human rights advocacy intersect. While the country maintains high public support for the death penalty, recent years have seen pauses and increased scrutiny, reflecting both domestic legal considerations and international pressures."

              "summary": "Here is a summarized overview of two high-profile death penalty cases in Japan, based on the provided query results:\n\n1. **Takahiro Shiraishi - The \"Twitter Killer\":**\n   - **Case Overview:** Takahiro Shiraishi, notorious for the moniker \"Twitter Killer,\" was sentenced to death on December 15, 2020, for the murder of nine individuals whom he contacted via Twitter. The case gained significant international attention and has been one of the most shocking in Japan in recent years.\n   - **Victims and Method:** Shiraishi targeted mostly young women who expressed suicidal thoughts on social media, luring them to his home under the guise of assisting them in their suicide. Between August and October 2017, he strangled and dismembered eight women and one man, aged 15 to 26.\n   - **Discovery:** Police discovered the gruesome reality of Shiraishi's crimes on Halloween 2017 when they found dismembered body parts in his flat while searching for a missing 23-year-old woman. The discovery, dubbed the \"house of horrors\" by media, included nine heads and numerous bones stored in coolers and toolboxes.\n   - **Trial:** During the trial, Shiraishi admitted to the murders. Prosecutors sought the death penalty, while his defense argued that he was guilty of \"murder with consent,\" as they claimed the victims had agreed to be killed. Public opinion in Japan largely supports the death penalty.\n   - **Impact:** The case sparked a national debate on how suicide is addressed online and underscored the dangers of social media manipulation.\n\n2. **Iwao Hakamada - Longest Serving Death Row Prisoner:**\n   - **Case Overview:** Iwao Hakamada, once the world's longest-serving death row inmate, was released in 2014 after spending over 45 years on death row. His conviction was based on a dubious confession obtained under torture and questionable evidence that the court later ruled could have been fabricated.\n   - **Condition upon Release:** Hakamada, who entered prison in good health, left mentally ill, showing signs of severe psychological distress resulting from solitary confinement and prolonged detention. His case has highlighted significant flaws in Japan's criminal justice system and the inhumane conditions on death row.\n   - **Mental Health Concerns:** Hakamada's deteriorating mental state, which began showing as early as 1980, is not an isolated case. Other inmates, like Matsumoto Kenji, have also suffered severe mental health decline while on death row, exacerbated by pre-existing intellectual disabilities.\n   - **Legal and Human Rights Issues:** Hakamada's case raises critical questions regarding the fairness of Japan's trial processes, the legitimacy of forced confessions, and the ethicality of extended solitary confinement. It underscores the need for substantial reforms to ensure the humane treatment of prisoners and the protection of their rights.\n   - **Public and Legal Reaction:** The case has fueled ongoing discussions about the death penalty's application, particularly concerning prisoners with mental disabilities and the possibility of wrongful executions. Hakamada's public declaration against the death penalty adds a personal narrative to the broader debate on capital punishment's moral and legal justifications.\n\nThese cases highlight significant issues within Japan’s death penalty system, including concerns about mental health, fair trials, and the impact of prolonged solitary confinement."

              "summary": "### Summary of Recent Execution News in Japan\n\n#### Overview\nIn 2023, Japan did not carry out any executions, marking a notable pause in its capital punishment practices. This development highlighted Japan's unique position within the Group of Seven (G7) nations, alongside the United States as the only countries retaining the death penalty, though only the U.S. carried out executions in 2023.\n\n#### Context and Possible Explanations\nSeveral factors have been posited for Japan's execution hiatus:\n1. **Political Climate**: The resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022, following controversial remarks about the death penalty, made it politically sensitive for his successors to authorize executions.\n2. **International Scrutiny**: Japan's leadership role in the G7 for 2023 may have contributed to increased international scrutiny, prompting a cautious approach to capital punishment.\n3. **Administrative Changes**: Changes in the Japanese cabinet and issues within the justice ministry, including reports of prisoner mistreatment, further complicated the scheduling of executions.\n\n#### Legal and Procedural Aspects\nJapanese law mandates that the Justice Minister schedule executions within six months of a finalized death sentence. However, in practice, death row inmates often wait an average of about 15 years due to ongoing sentence reviews and retrial petitions.\n\n#### Current Status\nAs of the end of 2023, Japan had 106 individuals on death row, with three inmates having passed away that year from causes other than execution. The most recent execution occurred on July 26, 2022, when Tomohiro Kato was executed for a mass stabbing in 2008. Since then, no further executions have been authorized.\n\n#### Human Rights and Legal Advocacy\n1. **Execution Practices**: Japan's execution practices involve informing prisoners about their execution only an hour before it occurs, a practice challenged in court as inhumane and unconstitutional by death row inmates and criticized by human rights organizations.\n2. **Public Opinion**: Despite these criticisms, public support for the death penalty remains high in Japan.\n3. **Advocacy for Abolition**: The Japan Federation Bar Association and international organizations like Amnesty International continue to advocate for the abolition of the death penalty, citing its inhumane nature and violations of international safeguards.\n\n#### Comparative Global Context\nGlobally, 144 out of 199 countries have abolished or suspended the death penalty by the end of 2022. Japan remains one of the 55 countries that still practice capital punishment, though its methods and the frequency of executions highlight diverse global approaches to this contentious issue.\n\n#### Conclusion\nJapan's halt in executions in 2023 underscores complex legal, political, and ethical dynamics surrounding capital punishment. Amid strong public support and international critique, the future of the death penalty in Japan remains a deeply polarizing and evolving debate.\n"

Key issues raised include inadequate legal counsel for death-row inmates and notification of execution on the day of the act. Concerns also persist about the overall humane treatment of prisoners on death row. As of July 2022, Japan had 106 prisoners on death row.\n   - **Death Penalty Information Center** report noted that Japan performed no executions in 2023, marking a break from practice likely influenced by international scrutiny as Japan led the G7. Political factors, including the resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi due to controversial comments, also impacted the halt in executions.\n\n2. **Public Deception and Secrecy**\n   - **Amnesty International** reveals that Japan resumed executions at times of national distraction, such as during debates on Japan's military role. Tsukasa Kanda’s execution in June 2015 exemplifies this, where Amnesty accused the government of avoiding public scrutiny. The Japanese government claims the death penalty functions as a deterrent, but lacks scientific evidence to support this.\n\n3. **Treatment of Death Row Inmates**\n   - Amnesty International and other organizations have criticized Japanese authorities for the secrecy surrounding executions. Inmates often receive only a few hours’ notice before their execution, and families are notified post-execution. Reports indicate that inmates are kept under strict solitary confinement and constant surveillance, raising human rights concerns.\n   - Claims of coerced confessions through torture or ill-treatment during police custody have surfaced. Such confessions have sometimes been accepted as evidence, further questioning the fairness of trials leading to death sentences.\n\n4. **Support and Criticism**\n   - Despite international criticism, domestic support for the death penalty in Japan remains high. The Japan Federation Bar Association advocates for better legal representation and ultimately seeks the abolition of the death penalty.\n\n5. **Statistical Context and Global Comparisons**\n   - Japan is one of the few industrialized democracies, alongside the United States, that retains the death penalty in practice. Globally, it is increasingly isolated in this stance with 140 states having abolished the practice either legally or in practice.\n\nThis summary reflects the complex dynamics surrounding the death penalty in Japan, where domestic support contrasts with significant international scrutiny and criticism from human rights organizations. The issues of legal fairness, inmate treatment, and governmental transparency remain central to the debate."

Although Japanese law demands executions be scheduled within six months of sentencing, prisoners often linger on death row for about 15 years. This year’s break in executions was attributed to the political fallout from a previous justice minister’s controversial comments on the death penalty and subsequent ministerial changes. The system is criticized for excessive secrecy and causing mental distress to inmates. While there has been advocacy against the death penalty from legal professionals, public support for it remains strong.\n- **URL**: [Death Penalty Info](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/japan-performed-no-executions-in-2023-making-u-s-the-only-g7-country-to-use-capital-punishment-last-year)\n\n**3. Wrongful Conviction – Sakae Menda**\n- **Article Title**: \"Sakae Menda - Wikipedia\"\n- **Summary**: Sakae Menda exemplifies a highly publicized wrongful conviction case in Japan. Convicted in 1949 for double homicide and sentenced to death, Menda spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated in 1983. This marked the first instance of a death row inmate being released following a retrial in Japan. Menda’s case significantly impacted the anti-death penalty movement, highlighting flaws in the Japanese judicial system where wrongful convictions can lead to fatal consequences.\n- **URL**: [Wikipedia - Sakae Menda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakae_Menda)\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Execution Practices**: Japan’s execution methods and secrecy are heavily criticized for being inhumane. The lack of adequate notice to prisoners and their families exacerbates the mental anguish associated with the death penalty.\n- **Legal and Political Factors**: Recent changes in the justice ministry and heightened international scrutiny have influenced the scheduling of executions, resulting in a pause in 2023.\n- **Wrongful Convictions**: There are notable cases like Sakae Menda’s, which underscore the risks of executing innocent people.\n- **Current Situation**: Support for the death penalty among the Japanese public remains high despite ongoing advocacy against it, reflecting a complex socio-political landscape.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe execution of innocent people is a critical issue within the context of Japan’s capital punishment system, illustrated by widely reported cases and advocacy from international and domestic organizations. The interplay between legal processes, political circumstances, and public opinion continues to shape the future of the death penalty in Japan."

Sakae Menda Case**\n\n**URL:** [Sakae Menda - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakae_Menda)\n\n**Summary:**\nSakae Menda is a notable figure in Japan's judicial history, having been wrongfully convicted of a double-homicide and sentenced to death in 1949. Menda's conviction was based on coerced confessions and inadequate legal representation. It was only after prolonged legal battles that he was exonerated in 1983 during a retrial—the first instance of a death row inmate being released by retrial in Japan. Menda's case has significantly contributed to the anti-death penalty movement in Japan, as he became an activist advocating against capital punishment. His story highlights the vulnerability of the judicial system to errors, especially under the death penalty, and underscores the implications of wrongful convictions.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Menda was convicted of murdering a Buddhist priest and his wife in 1948 based on flawed evidence.\n- His exoneration in 1983 marked a milestone as it was the first of its kind in Japan.\n- Menda became a prominent anti-death penalty activist after his release, influencing public and legal perspectives on capital punishment in Japan.\n\n**2.
