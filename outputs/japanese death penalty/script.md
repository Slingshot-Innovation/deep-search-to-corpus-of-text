## Introduction to the Death Penalty in Japan

### Historical Context

To grasp the historical context of the death penalty in Japan, it's vital to understand its deep-rooted origins and evolution. 

Japan's use of capital punishment extends back to ancient times, with its early legal systems incorporating death as a penalty for severe crimes. In the Edo period (1603-1868), execution methods included beheading, garrotting, and even ritual forced suicide, reflecting the harsh judicial practices of the time. 

The system, however, evolved significantly. The establishment of the modern Penal Code in the late 19th century formalized the use of the death penalty, predominantly reserving it for aggravated murder and other serious offenses. Currently, the Penal Code lists 14 capital crimes, but in practice, the death penalty is almost exclusively applied for aggravated murder. Interestingly, the death penalty also remains a mandatory sentence for "instigation to foreign aggression," although this is rarely, if ever, implemented.

The method of execution has modernized to long drop hanging, conducted in one of seven designated execution chambers located in major cities across the country. This method stands in stark contrast to historical practices, yet it symbolizes Japan's approach to capital punishment — strict and secretive.

Japan has witnessed fluctuating trends in executions over the years. A notable hiatus occurred between 1989 and 1993, followed by a resurgence in the enforcement of capital punishment, with 39 executions taking place between 1993 and 2000. More recently, since 2000, 98 executions have been conducted. Importantly, 2023 marked a year with no executions, distinguishing Japan alongside the U.S. as the only G7 nations to continue this practice in recent memory. As of early 2024, 106 inmates remain on death row, with no executions carried out in the previous year. Such dormancy periods often reflect political and international pressures; indeed, Japan's presidency of the G7 in 2023 and the resignation of the Justice Minister in 2022 played roles in delaying executions.

Public opinion in Japan strongly favors the continuation of the death penalty. In a 2019 poll, an overwhelming 80.8% of respondents supported its use, even when considering life imprisonment without parole as an alternative. This robust support underscores the societal acceptance and perceived necessity of capital punishment for deterring severe crimes.

Yet, the administration of the death penalty in Japan remains fraught with controversy due to its secretive nature. Inmates are kept in solitary confinement, often for years, and are typically informed of their execution only an hour before it occurs, a practice that has attracted legal suits claiming mental distress and unconstitutionality.

In summary, the history of the death penalty in Japan is a tale of evolution from ancient punitive customs to a modern yet controversial legal practice. It's maintained by strong public support, upheld with stringent secrecy, and occasionally influenced by political and international dynamics.

### Legal Framework

Japan’s legal framework paints a complex picture of how capital punishment is interwoven into the country’s justice system. Let's dive deeper.

The death penalty in Japan is firmly entrenched in the country's legal system, governed by the Japanese Penal Code, which lists 14 offenses that can merit a death sentence. However, in practice, the death penalty is almost exclusively reserved for aggravated murder cases.

Execution is carried out by long drop hanging, a method rooted in historical practice and utilized in one of the seven execution chambers scattered across major Japanese cities. Intriguingly, despite the severe nature of such punishment, the only crime that mandates a death sentence is the instigation of foreign aggression. This indicates a selective deployment of capital punishment within the legal apparatus.

A pivotal characteristic of Japan's death penalty system is its high level of secrecy. Executions are shrouded in mystery, with inmates informed of their execution only one hour prior. This practice has raised considerable human rights concerns, especially as families and lawyers receive notification only after the execution has taken place. This is compounded by the harsh conditions for death row inmates, who spend many years in solitary confinement.

Despite these criticisms, public support for the death penalty in Japan remains robust. A 2019 public poll revealed an 80.8% approval for continuing the death penalty. However, this support drops to 52% if life imprisonment without parole is introduced as an alternative.

Legal challenges have arisen against these practices. For instance, in 2021, two death row inmates filed a lawsuit challenging the short-notice execution process, arguing it caused significant mental distress and violated constitutional rights. Although initially dismissed by the Osaka District Court in 2024, the plaintiffs are appealing the decision.

Highlighting the intersection of legal action and human rights advocacy, groups like the Japan Federation Bar Association continue to push for reforms. They advocate for improved defense counsel for those facing capital punishment and, ultimately, aim for the abolition of the death penalty.

Recent trends signal potential shifts. Notably, Japan did not carry out any executions in 2023, a year where it held the G7 presidency, thus placing it under a global spotlight. This pause reflects the intricate balance between domestic policies and international scrutiny, suggesting the possibility of evolving attitudes towards capital punishment.

In summary, while Japan's legal framework supports the death penalty with a structured, albeit secretive, process, ongoing legal battles and international pressure provide a glimmer of hope for more humane and transparent practices in the future. This complex interplay of law, public opinion, and human rights concerns continues to shape the discourse surrounding capital punishment in Japan.

## Current Practices and Procedures

### Execution Methods

Execution methods in Japan have a long and complex history, with modern practices rooted in traditions that date back hundreds of years. Let’s dive into how these executions are carried out today.

Currently, the only method of execution in Japan is by long drop hanging. This method has been the standard since the late 19th century and is notable for its procedural and psychological complexities. Here’s how it works: the condemned person is blindfolded, their feet are bound, and their hands are cuffed. They are led to the gallows, where a trapdoor mechanism is triggered. Interestingly, this mechanism is controlled by multiple prison officers who press buttons simultaneously from an adjacent room, ensuring that no single officer knows who activated the trapdoor. This method aims to diffuse responsibility, but it has not been without criticism. There are concerns about the possibility of botched executions and the emotional burden placed on the officers involved.

Secrecy is a significant aspect of Japan's execution process. Inmates are often informed of their execution only an hour before it takes place. This practice, intended to maintain order and reduce potential disruptions, has been labeled psychologically cruel. Many inmates spend years, even decades, in solitary confinement, living under the constant surveillance of guards, which can add immense mental stress. Legal challenges have been raised, arguing that this practice amounts to inhumane treatment.

Despite its contentious nature, the death penalty enjoys strong support among the Japanese public. Surveys show that around 80% of the population believes capital punishment is necessary, often citing the need for justice for victims’ families. However, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations and various human rights groups have called for greater transparency and even the abolition of the death penalty. Their efforts face a significant uphill battle given the robust public backing.

From 2000 to 2023, Japan executed 98 inmates, with the last known execution occurring in July 2022. This involved Tomohiro Katō, the perpetrator of the 2008 Akihabara massacre. Another notable case was the 2018 execution of Shoko Asahara and 12 members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult who orchestrated the deadly 1995 sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway.

Critics, including international human rights organizations, have repeatedly highlighted the secrecy and psychological toll of Japan’s capital punishment system. They argue that notifying inmates mere hours before execution and prolonged solitary confinement are inhumane practices that need to be addressed.

In the broader context, Japan, alongside the United States, stands as one of the few G7 countries that still retain the death penalty. Although there were no executions in Japan in 2023, the country’s substantial death row population and the continued high level of public support indicate that capital punishment is unlikely to be abolished anytime soon. 

So, while executions in Japan are shrouded in secrecy and carry significant psychological impacts, both for the inmates and the officers involved, they remain a deeply entrenched part of the legal system—with widespread public backing ensuring their persistence for the foreseeable future.

### Detention and Death Row Conditions

Life on death row in Japan is strikingly severe, marked by oppressive isolation and psychological strain. Unlike some countries, where death row inmates may have limited social interactions and physical activities, Japan’s approach is particularly stringent. Inmates are placed in solitary confinement immediately, under constant video surveillance. This ensures they cannot make noise, walk around their cells, or engage in any meaningful activities. These harsh restrictions aim to maintain absolute control but at a significant cost to the prisoners' mental and physical health. 

Death row inmates may receive visits from close family members, but this is tightly controlled and monitored. Mail correspondence is subject to censorship. The rigid conditions and prolonged isolation often lead to substantial mental health deterioration over time. For many, the mental toll is compounded by a profound sense of disconnection or even abandonment by their families due to the stigma and stress associated with having a relative on death row.

One of the most controversial aspects of Japan's death row is the practice of notifying prisoners of their execution on the same day it is to be carried out, usually just hours before it happens. This practice plunges inmates into a state of perpetual anxiety and fear, never knowing which day will be their last. It also means that there is little to no time for last-minute legal challenges or for the prisoner to mentally prepare for their execution, contributing to severe psychological distress. International human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Council, have condemned this practice, branding it inhumane and a form of psychological torture.

Legal and human rights concerns regarding these practices run deep. In November 2021, two death row inmates filed a lawsuit against the Japanese government, alleging that the practice of same-day execution notification is “inhumane” and unconstitutional. They argued that it causes severe psychological distress and disallows legal recourse, making it nearly impossible to mount any last-minute legal defenses. These practices draw significant criticism from human rights groups, which argue that they fail to meet international standards for the treatment of prisoners and call for greater transparency and review mechanisms.

Historical cases, such as that of Iwao Hakamada—a former professional boxer who spent over 45 years on death row under these harsh conditions—underscore the severe and often contentious nature of Japan's death penalty system. Hakamada’s case is emblematic of the issues within the system, especially as modern forensic advancements have exonerated death row inmates in other countries. By the end of 2004, there were 118 inmates on death row in Japan, many of whom were waiting to face the same uncertainty and psychological torment as their predecessors.

Despite the criticisms and calls for reform from international bodies, Japan remains one of the few developed nations still employing the death penalty. This stance frequently subjects it to international scrutiny. However, Japan has consistently maintained that its application of the death penalty is essential for addressing its crime rates and upholding justice for the most severe offenses. This defense underscores a domestic perspective that prioritizes sovereign rights and local legal traditions over international pressures.

In summary, life on death row in Japan is marked by extreme isolation and psychological torment due to unpredictable execution dates. These conditions have faced extensive scrutiny from human rights organizations, illuminating a complex interplay of legal and human rights challenges within the Japanese capital punishment system. Despite these challenges and calls for reform, the practice continues, reflecting broader societal and governmental views on justice and crime prevention.

## Societal and Human Rights Perspectives

### Public Opinion

Public opinion on the death penalty in Japan is notably a decisive component in shaping its criminal justice policies. Let's delve into the data and nuances behind these perspectives.

First, let's look at the numbers. A government survey from 2009 highlighted that an overwhelming 86% of Japanese citizens supported the death penalty at that time. Flash forward to November 2019, a Cabinet Office poll indicated that 80.8% of the respondents still believed the death penalty was necessary, with only 9% advocating for its abolition. Significantly, this strong support has been steadfast, with over 80% of respondents consistently opposing the death penalty's abolition since 2004.

So, why is support for the death penalty so robust in Japan? One of the primary reasons is empathy for the victims and their families. Many Japanese people believe that life should be compensated with life, a sentiment deeply rooted in a sense of retributive justice. This belief aligns with the philosophical view that severe crimes warrant equally severe punishments. There's also a pervasive fear that if the death penalty were abolished, it could lead to an increase in violent crimes and even the possibility of dangerous criminals reoffending.

On the other side, the reasons for opposing the death penalty are just as compelling. Among the 9% who favor abolition, the major concern is the irreversibility of wrongful convictions. The possibility of executing an innocent person casts a long shadow over the justice system. Additionally, many opponents argue for life imprisonment without parole as a more humane and equally effective alternative. They see rehabilitation and the intrinsic value of human life, even for those who have committed severe crimes, as paramount.

This duality in perspectives is also reflected in the political landscape. The Justice Ministry in Japan has a firm stance against discontinuing the death penalty, partly because public opinion is so strongly in favor of retaining it. However, Japan's position stands in contrast to many other developed nations that have moved towards abolishing capital punishment, sparking debates both domestically and internationally.

Furthermore, the operational aspects of the death penalty in Japan have stirred controversy. Executions are carried out in secrecy, with prisoners typically informed just an hour before their sentences are enacted. This practice has fueled debates about the humanity and constitutionality of such procedures, leading some death row inmates to challenge them legally.

Advocacy groups like the Japan Federation of Bar Associations and international organizations such as Amnesty International continue to campaign for the abolition of the death penalty in Japan, painting the country as an outlier among developed nations.

In summary, while Japan's public opinion strongly favors the death penalty—largely driven by a desire for retributive justice and victim empathy—a significant minority raises ethical concerns about irreversibility and human rights. This intense dichotomy between support and opposition creates a complex backdrop for any discussions on capital punishment reforms in Japan.

### Human Rights Concerns

When it comes to human rights concerns, Japan's death penalty system has faced significant scrutiny, both domestically and internationally. One of the most controversial practices is the same-day execution notification, which was notably challenged in a lawsuit by two death-row inmates in November 2021. These inmates argued that the abrupt notification violates their constitutional rights and amounts to inhumane treatment, akin to psychological torture. This practice, which leaves prisoners in a state of constant uncertainty and fear, has been condemned by Amnesty International and other human rights organizations. The United Nations has also criticized this lack of transparency, urging Japan to align with international standards of humane treatment.

The UN Human Rights Committee's 2022 Concluding Observations emphasized several key issues. One major concern was the prolonged solitary confinement that many death-row inmates endure, sometimes for decades, severely impacting their mental health. The absence of procedural guarantees, such as a mandatory review system for capital cases and lack of independent mental health monitoring, exacerbates these conditions. Moreover, the committee highlighted the use of 24-hour video surveillance and inadequate medical services, which collectively contribute to a distressing environment for those awaiting execution.

The U.S. Department of State echoed these criticisms in its 2022 report, pointing out that Japan's policy of same-day execution notification, while intended to spare inmates from prolonged anguish, actually inflicts severe psychological harm. Additionally, the report noted the harsh living conditions for death row inmates, including solitary confinement with limited visitation rights and insufficient medical and mental healthcare. The physical conditions of the facilities themselves are also problematic, often lacking adequate heating in winter and cooling in summer.

Overall, these practices constitute serious human rights violations according to various international standards. The secrecy surrounding executions, the inadequate legal processes, and the severe psychological toll on inmates have led to widespread calls for Japan to either abolish the death penalty or implement significant reforms. Human rights organizations, alongside the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, advocate for greater transparency, improved legal protections, and more humane treatment of death row inmates.

Despite this, public opinion in Japan heavily supports the death penalty, with around 80.8% of citizens in favor according to a 2019 poll by the Cabinet Office. This support likely contributes to the government's steadfast retention of capital punishment, even as international pressure mounts. However, the consistent and severe human rights criticisms suggest a growing need for Japan to reconsider its approach to the death penalty, balancing both domestic sentiments and international human rights standards.

## Case Studies and Notable Examples

### Recent Executions

Recent executions in Japan have highlighted the country's unique and often controversial approach to capital punishment. Since 2000, Japan has executed 98 inmates, with the most recent execution taking place on July 26, 2022. Tomohiro Katō was put to death for the Akihabara massacre of 2008, where he killed seven people and injured ten others.

As of 2023, Japan has a significant population on death row—106 inmates—yet no executions were carried out that year. This made Japan and the U.S. the only G7 countries retaining the death penalty, though the U.S. was the sole nation to perform executions in 2023. Typically, executions in Japan are performed by hanging, with inmates notified only an hour before the execution. Families and lawyers receive the news posthumously, and the average time an inmate spends on death row is about 15 years.

Public opinion in Japan generally supports the death penalty, with a 2019 survey revealing that 80.8% of respondents favor its continued use. However, when presented with the alternative of life imprisonment without parole, this support dwindles significantly. Under these circumstances, 35.1% of respondents expressed a preference for abolition of the death penalty, indicating a nuanced perspective within the public discourse.

Political and administrative factors greatly affected the execution landscape in 2023. Japan held the role of G7 presidency, bringing heightened international scrutiny. Additionally, the resignation of Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi in 2022 over a controversial remark about executions rendered it politically sensitive for his successor to authorize any executions. Revelations of prisoner abuse and cabinet changes also contributed to the halt.

From a human rights perspective, organizations like Amnesty International have criticized the death penalty in Japan, labeling it cruel and inhumane. The execution of three inmates on December 21, 2021, was condemned as a missed opportunity for progress under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. These inmates included Yasutaka Fujishiro, convicted of killing seven relatives, and Mitsunori Onogawa and Tomoaki Takanezawa, both convicted of two murders.

Fujishiro’s execution was particularly controversial due to his diagnosis with a personality disorder, raising questions about mental health considerations in capital punishment. The other inmates faced execution despite pending retrial requests and contested appeals, which further fueled debates on the fairness and ethics of Japan's death penalty system.

Two high-profile cases also highlight significant issues within Japan’s death penalty framework: Takahiro Shiraishi, known as the "Twitter Killer," and Iwao Hakamada, the world’s longest-serving death row inmate. Shiraishi was sentenced to death in December 2020 for the murder of nine individuals he contacted via Twitter. His case underscored the dangers of social media manipulation and sparked national debates on online suicide and crime.

Iwao Hakamada, released in 2014 after spending over 45 years on death row, epitomizes the flaws in Japan’s justice system. His conviction was based on a confession allegedly obtained under torture and questionable evidence. Hakamada’s deteriorating mental health due to prolonged solitary confinement and his severe psychological distress shined a spotlight on the human rights abuses inherent in Japan's death penalty procedures.

In conclusion, the recent data and context on executions in Japan reveal a complex interplay between public support, political sensitivity, and human rights advocacy. While there's strong public backing for capital punishment, recent years show emerging pauses and international scrutiny, suggesting an evolving and contentious future for the death penalty in Japan.

### Controversial Cases

Now let's dive into some of the most controversial cases that cast a grim shadow over Japan's death penalty system.

Let's start with the case of Sakae Menda. Menda was wrongfully convicted in 1949 for a double-homicide he did not commit. He spent an agonizing 34 years on death row, all because of a coerced confession and inadequate legal counsel. It wasn’t until 1983 that he was exonerated in a retrial, marking the first instance of a death row inmate being released following a retrial in Japan's history. Menda's case has become a cornerstone for the anti-death penalty movement, underscoring the vulnerabilities within the Japanese judicial system that can lead to fatal consequences.

Another pivotal case in exposing the grim realities of wrongful convictions is that of Iwao Hakamada. Hakamada, a former professional boxer, was sentenced to death in 1968 for murders he steadfastly denied committing. He was released in 2014 after spending 48 years in isolation—his sentence being one of the longest recorded for a death row inmate. DNA testing eventually suggested he was innocent, yet his case dramatically illustrates the harrowing possibility of mistakes within the system, as pressure from interrogations and errors in investigations led to decades of unjust punishment.

International scrutiny has also been relentless. The Human Rights Watch World Report 2023 and organizations like Amnesty International have consistently highlighted ongoing concerns with Japan’s capital punishment practices. One of their major criticisms is the secrecy shrouding executions. For instance, prisoners are often informed about their execution just hours before it happens, and families are notified post-execution. This lack of transparency adds to the mental anguish not only for the inmates but also for their families.

Public deception is another alarming aspect. For example, back in June 2015, Japan resumed executions during a period of national distraction, as the government debated changes to Japan's military policies. The execution of Tsukasa Kanda during this time, Amnesty International argued, was a move to avoid public scrutiny, suggesting that the government manipulates timing to cushion itself from backlash.

Despite these controversies and international criticisms, domestic support for the death penalty in Japan remains robust. The Japan Federation of Bar Associations, alongside various human rights organizations, continues to advocate for better legal representation and ultimately, the abolition of the death penalty. Their arguments often hinge on documented miscarriages of justice and the risk they pose—not just to individuals, but to the integrity of Japan’s entire judicial system.

The complexity of Japan’s stance on the death penalty, caught between domestic support and international condemnation, raises vital questions about the future of capital punishment in the country. Each reported miscarriage of justice, like those of Sakae Menda and Iwao Hakamada, serves as a poignant reminder of the system's fallibility and the potentially irreversible consequences of its application.
